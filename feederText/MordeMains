I wemt "Welp, time to cry: trynda rework when" and the tryndamere replied with "Mordekaiser is even more broken than tryndamere". Im currently bronze 1. I know that in higher elos Mordekaiser is not considered to be that good, but is he considered OP in low elos?<|endoftext|>So no im not a mordekaiser main, but I ban him every game I play top, because no matter who I play, how I play it, I just cannot beat this overpowered overtuned rubbish, mordekaiser took a bad trade? too bad his passive will just win it for him and then he can just heal all of his health back up, and his ult is just pure bs a get out of jail free card. What annoys me is that the champ doesn't take skill or mechanics to play, he has one combo E Q, gets free damage from liyer auto attacking u, and all his abilities pass through targets so he doesn't even have to aim for the gap between minions, the ratio of skill to reward for this champ is far far too high and he really needs to be needed, and then given an actual ap bruiser item. I play a lot of sylas so I know its annoying not having an actual item to build, but even so mordekaiser is far far too strong in his current state.<|endoftext|>It would make our early way harder, and would mess with our item pool a bit, but wouldn't be so bad imo.


If he would use a lot of mana with low mana regen it would be a nightmare until first item. And we are already dealing with the problem of our W not being up just in time even tho the shield bar is fully up, if we couldn't do use a ability because we have low mana it would be terrible.


But it wouldn't be such a terrible thing if he didn't use a lot of mana and had a big mana regen. It wouldn't affect those who play tank Morde and those who love


But let's think about the items. If they made Morde a mana using champ we would be able to build Liandry and Everfrost, Seraph's embrace or even Luden's and the new tank item for mana using tanks. And we could buy corruption potion and elixir of sorcery would be just as good as elixir of iron.<|endoftext|>Hi Morde Mains!

https://preview.redd.it/19yyrlmboez71.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e47e5f48f90f01daba7bceb29f6710fa263cb03<|endoftext|>

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/qt53u8)<|endoftext|>After the Vars videos looks that many appear to have ideas to change Mordekaiser's ult.

So I'm asking: what's your idea for his ult?<|endoftext|>I kept his passive, q and w the same. I feel like they are reasonable abilities and other than some number tuning they are good to stay. His e and especially his ult are problematic in my opinion so I focused on them.

Passive: Mordekaiser's basic attacks deals bonus magic damage on-hit.

Damaging basic attacks and basic abilities grant Mordekaiser a stack for 4 seconds for every enemy. Champions or Monster hit, stacking up to 3 times. At 3 stacks, Mordekaiser gains Darkness Rise. Subsequent  damaging attacks and basic abilities against enemy champions and monsters refresh the duration.

Darkness rise: Mordekaiser deals magic damage per second to all nearby enemies and gains bonus movement speed.

Q: Mordekaiser smashes the area in the taget direction, dealing magic damage to all enemies within. Isolated hits with this ability deal increased damage.

W: Passive: Mordekaiser stores a percentage of the post-mitigation damage he deals and takes, reduced for non-champion sources, as Potential Shield on his secondary resource bar, up to a percentage of his maximum health. The Potential Shield decays every second after not dealing or taking damage.

Active: Mordekaiser consumes all his current Potential Shield to shield himself for for the same amount. The shield initially decays very slowly but exponentially increases near the end. Indestructible can be recast after 0.5 seconds while the shield is active.

Recast: Mordekaiser consumes the remaining shield, healing for a percentage of the amount.

E: Passive: Mordekaiser gains magic penetration.

Active: Mordekaiser slams his mace into the ground and sends forth a shockwave in a cone. The inner part deals damage and knocks up enemies hit, while the outer part deals no damage and slows enemies hit.

R: Passive: Whenever mordekaiser scores a takedown on an enemy champion he gains a shield equal to a percentage of their max health.

Active: Mordekaiser gains bonus shield power and ap for the duration. Mordekaiser can recast this ability.

Recast: Mordekaiser dashes a short distance in the target direction and empowers his next basic attack to root the target. Takedowns on enemy champions while the stat bonus is still active refresh the duration and allow mordekaiser to recast the dash. Mordekaiser may cast the dash during the cast time of any of his basic abilities.

The goal of this rework proposal is to turn morde into the mid-lategame teamfighter fantasy of a juggernaut rather than his current anti-carry stat-checker gameplay. The new e is meant to do just that. It is his primary gap-closer but it also rewards him for being on top of his target, which is how juggernauts are meant to be. Similarly with his ult. The current one takes up too much of his power budget and makes him impossible to balance, while also turning him into a statstick who just ults the adc. Adding an R that gives him a raid-boss status as well as a gap closer turns him into a true menance in teamfights rather than just an ult bot. 

Feel free to share your opinion on this idea.<|endoftext|>Havent seen any people cosplaying mordekaiser after his rework. Would be cool to see what people come up with for inspiration. Anyone seen anyone try?<|endoftext|>

https://preview.redd.it/2xvhsjpfccz71.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b57fdaf3b198b0da42238fd2787369f6150c860<|endoftext|>I've always felt that morde has a garbage level 1, maybe worst in the game. Yes if someone stands on top of you, outside of minions and lets you hit q to stack passive, he can be fine. But if you miss Q or hit someone with boneplating in a minion wave, might as well not have an ability. For 9 seconds you are a strong minion.

However, with w start, you have the ability to shake off poke and add regen too. And when you can into an all in, 150 free shield is massive early on. OFC I max Q still but w start has felt really good.<|endoftext|>I see a lot of talks on this subreddit day in and day out about Mordekaiser mini-rework ideas (personally my favorite one was the swap the passive and W, I wish that was a real thing), but let's face the facts: unless Mordekaiser grows a giant set of tiddies, he's not on the priority list for reworks or any serious changes that could make him better/more interesting to play.

Now, what Riot **SHOULD** be doing is looking to improve the UI and give QoL improvements/bug fixes (yeah actually maybe this last one is bad, Riot probably shouldn't touch this until they know for sure wtf they're doing) to his ult. So without further ado, here are my recommendations:

**1) Your team should be able to see your health bar and the enemy's health/mana bar in the death realm.** So many times i'll be playing with friends and I'll ult someone, and most of the times, I do win in the death realm, but other times I just use it to bring in Yi or another fed person and admittedly, they'll start winning the fight in the death realm, but they'll always ALWAYS be low hp. In cases like this, it'd be useful for your teammates to know information on health because then they can capitalize on it and get that pick. Currently, Mordekaiser's ultimate is just two dots and even then the dots aren't perfectly synced (sometimes there is a delay), so I think a position-visual fix is also up to demand.

**2) The cast time for the ultimate should be instant and not broken by dashes or invisibility.** I don't know what dumbfuck at Riot thought that Morde's ultimate should have a cast time, and then on top of having a cast time, the channel can be broken by invisible champions. It's a point and click ability for crying out loud. Master Yi's Q doesn't get cancelled by invisibility mid-way through the cast? Malzahar's ultimate doesn't get stopped mid-way through the cast? I could keep going, the list of non-cancelable point and click abilities is endless, but for some reason Mordekaiser's ultimate has a fuckin cast time and gets broken by dashes and invisibility which is absolutely stupid. Remove this mechanic and make it instant, absolute clown mechanic for no reason.

Beyond that, my personal wishes would be that death realm can't be QSS'd (this will probably never happen, but it should because if Zed's ultimate can't be QSS'd anymore, why should Mordekaisers?) or that they would decrease the diameter of the death realm so that it'd be easier to reach targets.<|endoftext|>Hi, i'm a vlad main p4 Euw, i come in this place to find a fellow active morde main that is ready and have the motivation to reach diamond next season. Why do i ask here ? Because i like playing with mordekaiser in general, like vlad he doesnt need his team to perform, he's a raid boss if ahead and handle 1V2, 1V3, (so it allows me to scale for free), i dont have to play around him and he doesnt have to play around me, his ult can allow me to win teamfighs alone if he remove the annoying tank with cc, and i think main morde is kind of cool :D. Here's my opgg,  [YankeeLaCisaille - Summoner Stats - League of Legends (op.gg)](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=YankeeLaCisaille)  ,reply if u are interested (i just start learn to play kassadin as a secondary champ 2 months ago, this explain the poor perf \^\^). Currently not ranking till next season (in 3 days).<|endoftext|>I only have a handfull of games on Morde, but I noticed the shop recommends Doran's Ring as a starter item. Is this solely for the benefit of having a boost to AP, since he is manaless? I know it gives a small heal on kill, I'm just curious when Doran's Ring should be taken over Doran's Sheild?

Edit: Thank you all for the varied responses! I will definitely play around with the different start setups based on your suggestions and find what works best for me. This community seems very kind and I appreciate it as a new Morde player!<|endoftext|>the people spamming that riftmaker is bad are total trolls, that item is very decent right now

demonic is also a fine item if the enemy team is mr heavy because all the pure mr items are trash

morde was just like kayle very decent during the end of the season because the riftmaker + nashor combo wasn't nerfed for a long time unlike gore and shieldbow<|endoftext|>I've been picking up mord lately and I've been noticing that I typically do well during the laning phase, but then I start throwing my lead once mid game comes around and people start to group. This is especially noticeable when the teams group up for an engage. Like I would ult the enemy [usually adc/support] and after I come out of my prison my team would of either lost the fight or have disengaged and I would come out surrounded.<|endoftext|>The Mordekaiser against Camille matchup

How should I play against this broken champ? And what should I avoid doing?
Just recently picked up mordekaiser and he is really fun, stay strong Morde mains!<|endoftext|>Morde has a few good qualities that would make him a good midlaner. First of all, his waveclear is really good, and he doesn't even need mana to do so. This means you can get prio by hard shoving, allowing you to rotate for your jungler and get an early advantage, akin to something like a zoe or galio. Secondly, his w is great into poke comps, often a poke mid lane will have to choose whether to hit the midlaner, or the midwave with their abilities, and if you deny the ability for them to do both, i.e. when xerath is charging his q, walk out of the wave, you can often just shove the wave on them and heal their poke with doran's shield + w heal. Well if you beat poke comps, melees must beat you surely? Nope, morde statchecks stuff like yasuo and yone early, and can hard punish them for farming with your e q since they actively have to walk within your radius when they do so, locking themselves in an auto or q animation. You can mitigate an assassins burst with your w too, so you can deal with nearly anything mid. Nothing comes to mind as a particularly bad matchup, bar maybe safe stuff like leblanc, but I mean who doesn't lose to leblanc?

When you pick up your predator boots, you can either use them to engage on your opponent, or roam after shoving a wave. You can use your ult in tandem with this to starve the opponent of counterplay. Hopefully you should pick up a few kills mid with your ult, or at least deny them a few waves. You have easy access to botlane too, meaning you can just run in and ult the adc for a free kill every time, unless its a vayne or something. Mid bushes aren't easily accessible like top, so playing around them to evade morde during his ult is not an option.

Morde falls off, but so does stuff like Galio, Pantheon, etc. Morde at least has his ult which remains an amazing tool for shutting down carries or forcing them to pay a qss tax to give your team a pretty hefty gold lead, which is probably better than a pantheon stun in all fairness. Its not like your useless late, in fact if you can force the enemy mid to fall behind, then shut them down in ult when they scale up you can definitely bring a lot of utility to your team.

As for disadvantages? Since you are running predator, you need to use it to get kills. Conq gives you way better dueling power, so you rely on being relatively ahead to statcheck people moreso than the Conq build. The shorter lane means that fighting for longer is harder, meaning that your passive has less value, often leaving a trade at e q auto passive for a short duration. Generally this means less because mid characters are more squishy than toplaners, but its still something to consider. Midlaners have more mobility than a lot of tops, so early when e is on a long cd, it might sting to be unable to hit it consistently. Since you are also playing to get your other lane ahead, while putting your laner as far behind as possible, there might be a chance that your other lanes can't carry or are just impossible to roam to. You can have more impact than morde top on average at least.

Opinions?<|endoftext|>His lore cites " As his mortal life neared its end, he took great satisfaction in knowing he had doubtless earned a seat at the gods’ table, in the glorious Hall of Bones, for all eternity. "

So how do you think he actually died in lore?

For me it personally would be the old ending from old lore where Mordekaiser met his mortal fate standing atop a mountain of corpses, surrounded by his foes. He laughed even as he died, pierced by arrows, swords and spears.<|endoftext|>Hello, fellow overlords.

I like *just* made this account for the express purpose of making this post, since I've been giving this idea some thought all day after watching Vars' "Badly Designed Abilities" video. As someone who's played a good chunk of the post-rework Mordekaiser and found it pretty fun, I don't think he really needs *another* full-on total gameplay overhaul like some of the ideas I've seen suggested here (those ideas are really cool, though). I think his current W is a really interesting and skill-expressive ability, and his current Q is basic enough where changes aren't really necessary without making it too strong. That being said, Realm of Death **absolutely** has to go; it's way too polarizing, takes up too much of Mordekaiser's power budget, and will likely only cause more problems for this champion down the line - more than it already has, anyway.

To that end, I think a good solution would be to juice his current E and switch it over to his ultimate, a little bit like what Riot did for Diana. I like the idea of having it be a really large area of effect, but with a fairly short fixed-distance pull like it currently has - I think it would still do a good job of selling the idea of an *inescapable* lord of death. As a new E, I think that one thing current Morde is desperately lacking in his kit is an *actual* combat steroid (e.g. Olaf W); he's one of the few fighters who has both only two damaging abilities (in this case, only Q and E) *and* no steroid, and is also pretty much the only champion in the game who straight up scales with game time?? (The duration of his stat boost on his current ultimate scales with enemy death timers, which in turn scales with the game timer. Super weird, IMO.)

For that reason, I think it would be a good idea to bring back Syphon of Destruction, and add some sort of buff/stat-stealing effect to it, but only when it actually damages a champion. A few of the ideas that I had were stealing a percentage of enemy champion's max HP, stealing enemy champions' attack speed, or a generic AP/damage boost. It might also be good to add either a brief or fairly weak slow attached to the E to compensate for the pull's transition to an ultimate, and thus its dramatically increased cooldown. While it could be a little too crazy to give a juggernaut an AoE self-buff/enemy debuff on a basic ability, I think the idea would definitely work to lean harder into Mordekaiser's identity as a really terrifying teamfight champion.

So, in short, the changes might look something like this.

P: Removal of the movement speed bonus; honestly, the fact that this buff is a flat 3% movement speed is barely noticeable anyway. Better to get rid of this and put the slow on E.

E: Shorter range version of old E, with a slow and some sort of steroid on hitting an enemy champion attached. Passive % magic pen. would still be here.

R: Nuts version of current Death's Grasp with bonkers width and length; I'm talking like **lane-wide**, but with a sizeable delay between the cast and the pull to compensate. Lower the damage to make up for the fact that you will likely never be able to miss this unless there's an Ahri on the enemy team, but keep the distance of the actual pull itself fairly short, so enemies on the edge wouldn't just immediately be flung right on top of you.

Obviously, this was just an idea I thought would be worth exploring and sharing with the community. What do you guys think? I'm interested to hear your responses.<|endoftext|>Hello Morde mains, enthusiasts and enjoyers.  Observe my ballsy yet logically-sound build for Morde Jungle.

Inspired in part by: SahnUzalEnjoyer, Byggherren and other Phase enjoyers.

&nbsp;

**TL;DR:**

**Primary Runes:**

Phase Rush

Nimbus Cloak

Celerity

Water Walking


**Secondary (flexible):**

Tenacity

Other of choice


**Ideal Items:**

1 - Lucidity Boots

2 - Riftmaker

3 - Anything you want or need!  

&nbsp;

**Reasoning and Playstyle details:**

I'll just say, Phase Rush seems to remove all of Morde's mobility issues, similar to using Ghost, yet has less restrictions.

Phase Rush's low cooldown means Morde is always ready to engage or retreat, unlike Ghost, where sometimes I pop it and do nothing, which I despise. (My fault but shit happens, usually early game). Further, Phase Rush has slow resist, something which prevents counters, unlike Ghost.

Furthermore, Waterwalking gives dueling power and speed for most key fights aka Dragon and Rift/Baron, which is perfect for Morde Jungle!

All that said, I've opted for Precision with Tenacity. This gives CC resist, which helps prevent direct counter to a good Phase Rush proc (though not completely, but Phase makes Morde nimble enough to dodge CC as well!).  I think other options are equally valid for secondary, such as Resolve tree if preferred, or any preference really.

Since I have mobility covered, I take Red Smite for damage reduction and true damage, along with opting for Ignite for more true damage and reduced heals.  With this setup, I can escape quickly if needed, but also hard engage and hard nuke to retaliate or dominate.

Red Smite combined with Ignite and Rift puts Morde's true damage % to champs somewhere around the 15-20%+ range, which IMO makes up for lack of Conq damage, and feels amazing.

Phase really strikes me as a far superior version of Fleet Footwork, which requires an auto attack, and isn't much speed, and superior to Conq, since we need less sustain and damage or stack uptime, when we are no longer as kiteable.  

Also, Phase is triggered/stacks with use of Red Smite AND Ignite, which makes it hilariously easy to proc when you need it most, not to mention synergy with Nimbus Cloak (5% speed on Red Smite is like a mini blue smite, Ignite yields 20% MS), and further ease of Phase uptime with Lucidity boots combined with low CD of Smite and Ignite!!!

Simply land 1 ability (E preferred as usual) or 1 auto. Then you Smite or Ignite as needed for speed boost (or both for EZ proc), then run them down and run laps around fools! Remember, Nimbus Cloak gives Ghosting which removed Morde's clunky model size collisions issues.

If you made it this far, thanks for listening. I made this build after not enjoying how inconsistent Conq was, particularly after the stack-duration nerf.

I hope to see some feedback, critique and comments!  To me, this is similar to the classic Frostfire + Ghost Morde, but more adaptable, more dangerous, more utility, and far less reliant on Ghost cooldown to gap close!

Cheers. May Iron Stand Eternal!

Edit: for readability and formatting only<|endoftext|>Is...the...worse....case...of...cancer....ever. 

There is no way, and I mean NO WAY on God's green earth, that crap is even remotely balanced.  

Now I understand, ranged vs melee, they normally poke you down, but the counter to that, is normally, once a melee is in range, he/she can catch up on that damage b/c both are in melee range. 



However, GRAVES, with Fleet, and shieldbow, is 100% broken.  It's not a "skill" matchup.  Its not a hug the tower matchup.  It's fn broke. Hard.

[Original stats: 30&#37; -15&#37; decaying movespeed and 60 AP instead of 75.](https://preview.redd.it/3lxzoo8l9ly71.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=375dcc28250016013780fd3c6faad7b476b2a4b9)

The movement speed being nerfed was expected, but I really wish they would buff the item's HP instead of giving it even more AP. Thoughts?  Feels like Rito wants Cosmic Drive to be used by assassins.

<|endoftext|>I can't see them on any notes.<|endoftext|>>!So, during Episode 2, Heimerdinger has a flashback warning about the dangers of magic and how it corrupts and destroys entire civilizations.

Heimer's been around for a few hundred years so it's possible he could have been there for part or all of Morde's reign. !<<|endoftext|>So the other day I was testing Mordekaiser in PBE,then I realised that his passive doesn't trigger demonic embrace's passive like it is on the current patch. Then I tried with Liandry and it works perfectly fine,his passive triggers liandry over and over like how it should be but it doesn't with demonic embrace. Is this a bug or a nerf? I think it's a bug because i once managed to make it work as intended but i couldnt reproduce that again. Do you think it'll go to live servers with the bug or they will notice it?<|endoftext|>So why they don't buff Mordekaiser resistances and fix the movespeed so we can do that and still be a juggernaut. If we go full AP rn everyone will one shot us latter in the game like we're nothing unless we're fed af.

clearly\*<|endoftext|>So out of nowhere I realized that mordekaiser's name sounds like the words morte, which roughly means death, and kaiser, which means king. Did somebody else notice this?<|endoftext|>He is the only champion that has a portion of the timeline calling him out, 400BN - 100BN Reign of the Iron Revenant, the Darkins are taken as a collective in the Great Darkins War 2000BN - 550BN, the Ruination of Helia Is noted at 25BN and the Rune Wars from 25BN - 3BN, No One is called out in these events by name, if Mordekaiser was notable enough to have a chapter of the timeline he has to be the single greatest evil to walk Runeterra.<|endoftext|>

———

The sun was rising, the birds chirping and Mordekaisers morning wood was not going away.

„None can escape me“ Mordekaiser proclaimed.

Something had to be done about this mischievous naughty boy. Iron might stand eternal, but his patience would soon not. Mordekaiser gatherers his energy and hardens his resolve. It was time to go.

„The world has tried to forget my existence, time to remind them why they fear“

You could feel the determination radiating from his pulsing member.

„Destiny, domination, deceit“

Mordekaiser brushes his teeth and quickly eats a croissant, making sure to swallow it whole. It tasted better that way, at least so he thought. Grabbing his key, and his mace in this instance, Mordekaiser rushes outside in order to find his grandpa, Zilean. Oh his uncle, ever the eccentric. He once made Mordekaiser eat some shrooms and proclaimed he would show him some time magic. Mordekaiser doesent remember well, but as a kid he always found it weird how his granpa would pant and thrash as he proceeded with his time shenanigans.

„In the world beyond, blackened ichor filled a crumbling sky, as souls withered to nothing. But i refused to fade“

Such is the mind of a child, remembering horrid experiences of the past in outlandish and cryptic ways. However, he now remembered, EVERYTHING his grandpa did. And someone had to pay.

„Haaaahh, life is a bitter shame“

Mordekaisers life was now a mess. His grandpa had ruined his....drive of carnal pleasure, he could not sustain meaningful relationships anymore.

„I refuse to fade...“

It was time. With a swift motion, he pulls out his iRealm phone. Quickly he dials his friends, darius and aatrox.

„Blyat!!“

Aatrox hailed from russia. He was a war criminal.

„They will regret opposing me“

Darius was an army veteran. He had tragically lost his wife in the heat of battle. Never did he forget of her, never did he get over this lost.

„Finality approaches“

Darius and aatrox quickly drive to pick up Mordekaiser. They had payback to deliver, time was off the essence.

„Once i suffered a mortal body, now i am iron incarnate“

There was an accident once, at grandpas home. Performing his time magics, as you do, he broke mordekaisers arm. And the other arm. And both of his legs. The bones were beyond repair, and through DeathRealm inc. they replaced them with Iron shards instead.

„I have my orders!“

Darius began to drive like a madman. He had killed a couple of people like this but courts ruled it over as just his ptsd handicapping him.

„This cursed form...this crude decaying FLESH! I loathe it“

Aatrox was recruited as a willing test subject by Targon inc. The supervisor of his experiment was an elusive women that went by the alias „Aspect of Twilight“. He would find her, one day. For what they did to him.

„Through the blackened gate!“

Exclaimed Mordekaiser. They had arrived at his grandpas palace of nightmares. The architecture was....weird. As if motives and architectural highs of different time periods all converged into one mess of a building.

„Naive men pray to the gods, they will learn to pray to me“

„Dont turn your back, or expose your neck“

„Pray, fool! You face a Blyat“

In front of this chaotic mansion they would make their march.

„No remorse“

If anything, mordekaiser was going to enjoy this. Deep down however, he felt a certain disgusting feeling of affection for the familiar walls of this mansion. And from a window, a lone figure observed.

Part 2 if this catches on<|endoftext|>I feel like Morde just sucks ass in gold 1 / plat 4, i can dominate my lane and even bail out bot with a tp and try to 1v5 like i would be able to when i was silver 2 but now the entire enemy team including the support will build QSS. Pretty much every single ability is impossible to land unless I hold them which I can only do if someone else isn't fed. The only reason I even started one tricking Morde was because I could carry Dogwater teammates no matter how they performed. I think leaving Morde behind is for the best and picking a 200-year balanced champion like Yone is the move. Feels bad that I invested 1k games into this champ. (maybe i'm just really salty rn from losing but I genuinely think that Morde is a counter pick only champ).<|endoftext|>So I checked on Porofessor to see how the winrates are doing in high elo. I'm not really playing ranked, I just played the matches to get a rank and left it be, but I have decided to see who is doing best in high elo, because I was like "Morde sucks in high elo, so fuck it" and I wanted to find a champ to climb with and sorted by winrate in Master+ on top and I couldn't be more suprised to see Morde being number 5 at the top.


As I am writing this I just restarted Porofessor to make it sure, and it's still the same. He was up there before too and I was like it must change the next day him ending up with 47% winrate at the bottom, but to my suprise nothing much have changed.


In Master+ elo he have a 2.3% popularity 1% banrate and 54% winrate. Core items being Rift first, Demonic second and Zhonya's third. End items being Spirit Visage, Thornmail and Cosmic (in this order). Before that the only thing different was that instead of Cosmic it was a Rylais last item.


Runes are conq, Legend Tenacity, Last stand, and Bone plating with revitalize (92.6% popularity and 55.9% winrate) there was a rune set that had a very low pickrate but around 66% winrate. It have dropped to 50% since the time I have checked. It included Grasp with Precision secondary.


And I just checked U.gg Morde in high elo is moving between A and S rank with similar runes and items being told above. He used to be D tier. The stats are a bit different than on Porofessor but that doesn't matter.


Wtf happened, he used to be suck with low winrate and his items being suck, what the hell did you guys who play ranked do? I'm actually suprised, wow this feels great. We started to do better than that fuckface Fiora.<|endoftext|>

So I was playing top lane against Morde as Garen. I absolutely DUMPSTER him in laning phase. Mid game comes around, he starts splitting bot so I go bot as well. I start to 1v1 him, he ults me and we both fight. I ignite, use all of my spells and HE STILL BEAT ME. Mind you I was one level up and also had ONE WHOLE COMPLETE ITEM than him. Okay so I thought he just got unlucky so I decided to 1v1 him as soon as I respawned. He didn’t have ult and again I used all of my abilities including ult and STILL LOST.   


Just wanted to vent thanks<|endoftext|>Since Shen can see into the spirit realm and has an actual spiritual blade, do you guys think he could threaten our might revenant?<|endoftext|>So while trying out some season 12 item changes, I noticed some of the mage items work really well with Mord and so I made this silly build to bonk enemies with, so here it is:


Runes can be whatever you want idk have fun but what I went with was
 
Primary:
Grasp of the undying
Demolish
Bone plating
Revitalize

Secondary:

Taste of blood and Ravenous Hunter

Now the actual build: Riftmaker, boots, Rylai's crystal scepter, Horizon focus, Demonic embrace and finally Cosmic drive.

All these items give HP which lets DE give you more ap, Rylai's procs Horizon for big damage and Cosmic drive gives that burst of MS and extra AP after getting passive, making it even harder for enemies to escape. Your passive damage aura also has some pretty nutty damage and constantly procs RCS, HF, DE and CD.

All the items combined give you 1,5k HP, 437 AP, 60 AH, making you hit pretty hard while also not getting popped.

That's it, hope y'all can have as much fun with it as I did.<|endoftext|>What's the best way to ult a long-ranged target that can kite down your health before you ult them? I understand that Marksmen counter Juggernauts, but surely there's something I'm missing. Also, I went up against a Lux support last game and that makes it even harder to get to the ADC. In fact, even the Lux could whittle me down quite a bit before I got to her and it was really hard to finally kill her in the death realm, and by then my team had gotten obliterated by a Kayn and Fizz. 

So yeah, how do use your ultimate most effectively and without dying in the process?<|endoftext|>And to make matters worse, I am a devoted Morde main and he was not ( I checked his account). So I'm asking if there're any tips I can use when facing a fellow Morde.<|endoftext|>

So glad I was able to close this out before the end of the season :)<|endoftext|>Cosmic drive Changes especially the passive combine with Morde Passive looks better than Riftmaker 

Cosmic Drive

60 ability power

250 health

30 ability haste

Five percent movement speed

After damaging champions with three separate attacks or spells, gain 30 percent movement speed decaying to 15 percent) and 40 ability power until leaving combat<|endoftext|>Lethal Tempo, Triumph, Alacrity, Last Stand

Celerity and Water Walking

Normal Morde build

Personally i dont use flash, i just have exhaust. Smite is an obvious, go for chilling smite (its actually been so long since i've used smite, i've forgotten what its like)

Now proceed to dominate

Clears are nice and no can beat you, 1v1 early so scuttle is all yours unless enemy team rotates<|endoftext|>Objective, focusing Mordekaiser's identity as a teamfighting AoE Titan, i despise Realm of Death for cockblocking the rest of his kit. This is what i would do if i given the rains to change him. I did not want to change how his kit is supposed to work foundementally so i only made large changes to his Ultimate and a medium sized change to his auto attacks to accomodate said refocus.

EDIT : typos

EDIT 2 : number adjustments with help of u/JustRevDice<|endoftext|> Hi! I venture to say that maybe I've been sinning in the itemization of Mordekaiser sometimes. I use the default Conqueror rune: Triumph - Tenacity - Last Stand // Resolve, with Revitalize and Bone Plating (I've seen some people using Second Wind); But when buying items at the base, in addition to the Riftmaker, I'm afraid to make items like Nashor's Tooth or Demonic Embrace and Rylai, valuing more the "tank" side of the character, but I see that most of the time, it's useless . In addition to the items, I would like to know how you organize the build order, so that I can also focus more on this part.<|endoftext|>Ever since i stopped playing around 2019, i saw some ... questionable champion entires and so on.  
Mordekaiser was just a big nail and the final one in the coffin for me.  
Is he still in the same state as he has always been? Or did some items or something change his state?<|endoftext|>[https://youtu.be/yEG799eDlmg](https://youtu.be/yEG799eDlmg)<|endoftext|>So I made a post about the new tank item and that I fear the mana using melee top laners abusing it, and omnivamp got brought up in the comments and I did some calculations and I'm not happy with the numbers.


Let's get some stuff straight because there are stuff that I didn't know, and probably many who don't know much (new players mostly). Skip these if you want to.


1. If Morde hits only 1 target, it counts as single target damage. It only counts as aoe of there is 2 or more target.


2. Omnivamp for those who don't know how it works: You heal from any damage you have dealt, no matter if it's physical, magic or true damage. The healing is based on the % omnivamp you have. If it's an aoe damage, the healing is only 33% effective. That means you only get the 33% of the hp that you would have healed back with the % omnivamp.


3. If you have 40% grievous wound effect on you, you only get heal back 60% of what you would actually heal back. If you have 60% on you, you only heal back 40% of what you would actually heal.


4. Spirit Visage and revitalize are only boosting how effective the healing is. Doesn't give more omnivamp, just helps it. With the 2 combined your healing is stronger and the shield you get is bigger with 30% (35% if below 40% max health)

My example scenario will probably help understanding the stuff above.


Now to the stuff. Let's say we are around 40 mins into a game with full build with no revitalize and Spirit Visage, full ap with Gathering storm, shit ton of ap and we ult the enemy jungler and our q landed on him, dealing 500 magic damage, nearly killing them.


 With full build we will have 18% omnivamp, sounds a lot, but the funny thing is that we heal barely heal anything. Because we only healed 90 hp with that hit. If we have Spirit Visage and revitalize (still dealing 500 with the Q) the being would have been 30% (or 35%) stronger. So we would have healed back 117 (or 121,5) hp. Not even the quarter of the damage we have dealt.


So the numbers of the healing are: 90 hp (without Spirit and revitalize) 94,5 hp (revitalize above 40% hp)  99 hp (revitalize below 40%) 112,5 hp (with Spirit only) 117 hp (Spirit and revitalize above 40% hp) and 121,5 hp (Spirit and revitalize below 40% hp)


Now let's see the numbers with anti-heal effect on us


40% grievous wound: 54 hp (without anything) 56,7 hp (revitalize above 40% hp) 59,4 hp (revitalize below 40% hp)  67,5 hp (Spirit only) 70,2 hp (Spirit and revitalize above 40% hp) and 72,9 hp (Spirit and revitalize below 40%hp)


60% grievous wound: 36 hp (without anything) 37,8 hp (revitalize above 40% hp) 39,6 hp (revitalize below 40% hp) 45 hp (Spirit only) 46,8 hp (Spirit and revitalize above 40% hp) and 48,6 hp (Spirit and revitalize below 40%hp)


And the 500 damage with a Q is an almost unrealistic damage. With lower and more realistic damage the numbers are even worse, and would be worse if even the isolated Q would count as aoe damage and get only 33% of the numbers.<|endoftext|>i ulted her i dodged her ult she grounded me and she bursted me with her dps even in mlee range i landed everything but i was like almost half hp when i reached her and i could not flash to get her in time cuz the ground, can i pick ghost instead of tp i feel like this champ is really slow when chasing someone without passive whats the deal with cassio??<|endoftext|>For toplaners I dont recommend ulting fiora since she will literally kill you in your own house. Definitely dont ult trundle since he will just take back all of his stats and slap you to death . Dont try to fight vayne either since she will just dodge everything and stun you into a wall. 

For junglers who try to gank you, dont ult kayn since he will just stall out using his ult.  Master yi is a bad idea as well since he can easily evade your skillshots with q or negate all your dmg with w. If hes fed enough he will rip through your hp with his true dmg bs. 

Anyone that im missing?<|endoftext|>We are not the only one who are excited for the new items.


The new Demonic is going to be a must have for ap brusiers and tanks, like singed and cho. And the new tank item, the manamune/muramana of top lane.


Bonus hp equal to 8% mana. Winters approach gives 500, once it turns into fimbulwinter it will give 860 mana and when they immobilize/slow a champ they consume 3% of their current mana and get shielded, and the shield is bigger if there is multiple enemy champ nearby. Almost everyone in top lane is going to abuse this item. Specially Singed, be prepared that you will see him often after the item changes.


We have a reason to be excited and happy. We all can agree that the current item pool for Mordekaiser is not the best, and the item changes will give even more space to the already strong tank Mordekaiser, but we are not the only ones who have a reason to be excited. But hey we will probably see champs in top lane other than Irelia, Riven, f i o r a and other currently meta top lane champs.<|endoftext|>So this happened about 5 mins ago in a VS bots game.  I just wanted to try out my new skin A random jinx and trist just started flaming for nothing. Idk why but i got nervous as they are smurfing and grinding in bot games. So here is the backfire. (sorry for the toxicity but i dont know how to tell you guys this in another way)

[So they were calling me a Nerd for playing one vs bots game. And even said Morde is a no skill champ, and no brain. ](https://preview.redd.it/ztx60b970mw71.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=eae4741701d48700f687bf09a2fb7e913f9065e6)<|endoftext|>Hi everybody, 
I had an idea for Mordekaisers ult that stays true to the vision that the devs had for him, by adding a passive! 

[ult passive] Blackened Ichor: Upon leaving the Death Realm, remnants of his deadly plane seep into the rift, creating a circle of plague that damages enemies at the same rate as mordes passive, and decreases movement speed by 5%. 


What do y’all think?? I think it could actually be a really great addition.<|endoftext|>Just a fun hypothetical concept of how I would have liked to see Morde reworked. (I am not asking for this to happen.)

https://preview.redd.it/541ny5c1zgw71.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ff4e263b9c930bb6d8d63a6ad77201e2b24ef68<|endoftext|>[https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=TophIiyah](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=TophIiyah)



Seeing quite a bit of success so far in low gold, hard carrying a bunch of games despite playing the champ for basically the first time a few days ago. Going Conq-Triump-\[Tenacity or Alacrity\]-Last Stand and Boneplating-Revilatize. I try to get cdr boots and dark seal on first back.



Clear is really fast. I originally tried nashors after riftmaker, but I think I like cosmic drive better to have more movement speed. 



Thinking about trying out predator against squishy teams, but triumph/legend/last stand is a lot to give up on. I tried ghost for a little, but I think I prefer flash.<|endoftext|>

I was playing mordekaiser against a Teemo top and while it sucked in the beginning (team went 1-6 for the first 4 minutes) and I died to the enemy jungler. I eventually got fed up with losing cs due to fear of Teemo and then I got my first kill. And then I only died one more time throughout the entire game. Ultimately I want 12/2 while teemo went 0/7 and this resulted in a little heated flame war between me and Teemo. He was saying i needed my ult to kill him so I killed him without ult. He was saying that mordekaiser was a really broken champ and I said to say something when he can get kills and his only reply was to say "say something when you learn a champion who takes more than 25 seconds" I then proceeded to take soul, take nashor, and hard push till we took inhib and won game and then he tried to scream report galio for trolling. Mind you galio was the only person on their team with a positive kd he was 3/1. Honestly speaking the shitshow was hilarious. And I was happy to get the LP. Im not a smurf and im not a troll i just really like mordekaiser.

What's best to build when ahead and snowballing, and what's best to build when even or behind? I've been going Riftmaker and Frostfire Gauntlet but curious to see other options.<|endoftext|>This name. It brings nightmares to me.

Anyone got any idea how to not suffer vs her?

One more thing: gwen is immune.<|endoftext|>the way morde functions in low elo is fine because people can't sidestep

in highelo the champ is pretty much unplayable because you can just reactively dodge all his spells

reactively sidestepping should not be the counterplay to q at the very least, it makes the whole champ a minion<|endoftext|>Is it me or do people low health under tower always forget Mord has a pull?<|endoftext|>Hi guys, I have recently started to pick up LoL again to play with my friends. I currently main top lane and I play in Gold and below ranks. I have been trying to come up with 3 champions on top lane that excel at different things. Currently I mainly play Cho'gath due to his AP scaling into the late game and tankiness giving me many chances in my elo range. I have been thinking about Morde as well because of how smooth and great it feels to play him, however, I also wanted to take the opinions of the people that main this character. In what way is Morde different than Cho (both of them are AP tanks from what I see), can I snowball and take over games from top lane in my elo range with him, and how are his match ups against the current meta picks? Additionally, I would really appreciate if you could suggest me some top lane champions for my champion pool. Thanks in advance :)<|endoftext|>Or does it put it on partial cooldown?<|endoftext|>Can anyone give me his experience with this skin as i intend to buy it since it is on sale and i get bored from DS skin
My only concern is his E is pay to lose or nah it is fine<|endoftext|>So I've just been thinking that mordekaiser doesn't truly match up to the 200 years champions riots been releasing lately. So I thought that maybe a super simple change would make mordekaiser E like how rumble ult and Viktor e is, where you aim it in one direction and drag it so the ability is aimed in said direction? Would give mord more versatility compared to the very predictable E he already has, and maybe we could increase the pullback the E has aswell? Not sure and I was just wondering what other fellow mord mains might think of this change. Could add some really cool skill expression<|endoftext|>GIVE ME SHIELDS OR GIVE ME DEATH.

Saw T1 get his shit absolutely kicked in by sunderer playing Morde and thought to myself “hey I swear to god Morde is broken but they always complain about his mythic so why not just use the best mythic in the game?”. So I went ahead and tested it out in practice tool and found out that Morde at level 9 vs a 1500 HP target with 50 armor/MR does slightly more damage than riftmaker in an E iso Q Auto rotation. Keep in mind this is Morde with only one item so we aren’t even taking into account the mythic passive that you get that is giving you MR/Armor pen or the omnivamp from rift but we all know that rift omnivamp is nothing especially compared to sunderer healing. So since I can’t be bothered to test both options myself in multiple games and also not having the time I came here to ask y’all if you could try it out and give me some thoughts on it. Looking at next season especially I could definitely see a sunderer into demonhelm build cause of the percent HP to AP passive being added.<|endoftext|>

https://preview.redd.it/syygju8tkov71.png?width=399&format=png&auto=webp&s=ced742e32e0b14e6130b836d144d52fb041e6af0<|endoftext|>So Evenshroud... This particular tank mythic item that's currently in the PBE has: 

200 Health

20 AH

30 armor

30 magic resist 

and this: Coruscation: Afterimmobilizing a champion or being immobilized, cause target and all nearby enemy champions to take 12% increased damage for 5 seconds.

And the mythic passive: + 5 armor and magic resist for legendary items.

I'm wondering if this, along with Demonic Embrace, Shadowflame (also new item in PBE, gives HP and AP plus magic pen, useful against people that used shields recently) + tank items could work for Mordekaiser. Thoughts?<|endoftext|>Just wanted to let you all know Project Morde is on sale for 1350 RP this week =]<|endoftext|>For 1350rp instead of 1820rp.

Since it's a legendary skin it's PROBABLY the only time it will ever be on sale.<|endoftext|>So Sett can feel like a difficult matchup but morde can win the stat check by waiting until level 4/5 and buying steelcaps. (And dodging sett W of course) 

Does anyone else know of matchups that can feel difficult for mordekaiser but become relatively easy as long as you wait for a specific time to go all in? Someone who doesn’t know when to fight sett might get dumpstered because he will force you to lose cs until you are strong enough to fight him, and I wonder if any other matchups are like that which might feel difficult but just require patience for a specific moment to strike?

Like when does morde win the stat check against Darius for example<|endoftext|>Will the Project skin go on sale? I read that every legendary skin will be on sale for 1350 at least once after release, most likely in the following 6 months after its release. Should we be expecting it to come around next month since it was released in May? Or is this no longer the case with legendaries.<|endoftext|>Hello guys, I played 1452 games of Mordekaiser this Season so far ( Peaked 410 LP EUW Recently, DONNE TON PSEUDO on EUW if you're interested ) and I'd really like to make this post because I'm done with Riot's way of handling Mordekaiser and I'd like Real Noticeable Change that Improves Gameplay, Fluidity and Quality of Life instead of generic Stat Buffs.

They have buffed him quite an important amount of times and he's still showing signs of being weak at the higher ranks. Now I know lots of you blame it on the Removal of Liandry and on AP items being relatively underpowered (thank god they are finally addressing that at least), but I think there are deeper problems that make Mordekaiser a champion not consistent enough ( especially relative to other juggernauts like Darius ) as well as too clunky and not rewarding enough when played properly.

I think Mordekaiser will be bound to have a below 50% WR at high rank simply because little amounts of mobility coupled with good ping and reflexes will make almost any player able to dodge Q and E, as well as being smart enough to buy QSS and Zhonya to nearly entirely negate R, without even mentioning cancelling the cast with stealth/vision loss.

However, to me these things are "fine" and are just part of the counterplay to Mordekaiser, what I'd want to be addressed is what makes Mordekaiser frustrating to play and renders him further useless if executed properly.

Here are my suggestions ( Most Important Ones First ) :



* **Passive :**

**- Now Grant a stack when hitting Invincible Targets** ( Kayle/Taric/Kindred R Pantheon E ) and/or Auto Attacking **Dodging Jax** and when **Blinded by Teemo** ( FYI you already get a stack when Shen W your Auto Attacks, and I think it should be the same for the other ones listed here )

I know these interactions don't occur every game, but the fact that good players can easily make Mordekaiser's passive reset IN COMBAT by just kiting and CCing him is already pretty frustrating, but if you add on top of that these interactions it just becomes infuriating and I feel like those should definitely change to make Mordekaiser's Passive less negatable in these Matchups.

**- Now Refreshes itself** ( this would mean that dealing damage with passive refreshes its 4 seconds duration ) \[ I'm aware this one could be very toxic and It might be a too worth trade for the Exchange Below but maybe it would be just fine \]

**-** ***In exchange*** **:** Remove the +3% Movement Speed when active.

I know some of you may be like " just bring back up the passive duration from 4 to 6 Seconds ", and I agree it would work and have the same effect as the intended ones above but the problem is that this would have a bigger impact and also buff him in scenarios where he doesn't require a buff.

Reducing the duration from 6 to 4 seconds was a good change that did make Mordekaiser less annoying to fight and gave proper time for people to breathe when Kitting / Disendgaging him.

Also, I know some people would Prefer having the Movement Speed buffed to have it scaling on levels like it used to be. But to be fair it was the major thing that made Mordekaiser so toxic on release as you could easily run down people by simply proccing passive.

I also know this would remove his only Mobility but I don't think this would be a disaster since you can get so much from Runes and Items nowadays. The 3% MS didn't do MUCH anyway and Darius can live without mobility in his kit so why wouldn't we be able to do the same ?



* **R :**

**- Grant a Stack of Passive / Refreshes it**

**- Goes on a WAY Shorter Cooldown if Cancelled** ( 10% Cooldown ? 20 Seconds ? Idk really ) I'm talking about Cancelled AND NOT Cleansed by Rengar/Gankplank W, QSS or Olaf R ( if he does it AFTER you R ). I'm talking about when you press R and the target gets Crowd Control or Displacement Immunity during the cast, which makes you steal no stats and have your R go on Full Cooldown.

Now I know this would maybe have to be looked at carefully for things like SpellShields and Mundo's Passive, but I think it would REALLY help Mordekaiser being better at the higher ranks where people easily abuse of their ability to COMPLETELY Negate Mordekaiser Ult.

Having to stand still and do nothing for the 0.5 Second cast time for your Ult to do nothing and go on cooldown is punishing enough, it shouldn't go on such a long cooldown because it simply makes certain matchups against good players extremely frustrating to play since it's relatively easy to react to it when it has a 0.5 Second cast time.

Here is a quick list of things that can easily completely negate Mordekaiser's R and that skilled player very often abuse :- Yone E2 / Warwick Q / Fiora Morgana Ornn W / Vi Volibear Shyvana Warwick Malphite Viego Illaoi Nocturne Sett Jarvan Hecarim Sion Kled Rammus Vex R



* **Q :**

**- Cooldown :**  9 / 7.75 / 6.5 / 5.25 / 4 -> 9.5 / 8.25 / 7 / 5.75 / 4.5 ( +0.5 Second at all Ranks )

**- Cooldown :**  Now Starts on Cast ( Reminder : Morde's Q has a 0.5 Second cast time )

This wouldn't change Q's CD at 0 ability Haste but make it Shorter the more Ability Haste you get.

Basically, Morde's Q Cooldown starts at the end of the cast like most abilities. However, this is HUGE when the ability has a LONG 0.5 cast time and a SHORT Cooldown, this means that a quite big portion of the ACTUAL Cooldown isn't reduced by Ability Haste which renders Ability Haste Purchase Less Rewarding.

Here is a Graph of the Change : [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/0bwf3rl5bc](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/0bwf3rl5bc) X is Ability Haste. You can note that the buff would have a Linear Frequency Increase depending on Ability Haste which is healthy since Ability Haste is intended to work this way.



* **W :**

**- Can be Cast During Q , E and R Cast Time** ( If not CCed )

In the same spirit of making Mordekaiser's Long cast times Weight him down Less, this would be a minor change that would make Mordekaiser more fluid and slightly less vulnerable when using abilities .

Reminder : E R Q ing someone Self Stuns you for 1.25 Seconds of cast time which is very long. Being able to W during this basic combo would definitely Help.



I Hope you guys like it and if you aggree with these suggestions I really invite you to share this post in the hope that it gets noticed by Riot. Even if only 1 of these changes gets implemented I would be very very very Happy.<|endoftext|>After reading all of your comments and checking every single point of view, yesterday a quick and old memory came to my mind, when I was little I used to play Mortal Kombat in the PS2, and I realized I forgot about my favourite character Shao Khan. A war emperor who rules The Outworld, he conquered other reigns. I bought Mortal Kombat 11 and his DLC, I literally filled that emptiness I felt inside of being in the boots of a cruel warlord with his powerful weapon crushing sould into morter.

I wanted to share this to you if you wanna try it, or watch videos on the internet it's kinda nice to play him, I got my PS3 controller, turned on the game, do the tutorial and start a tournament. I definitely like the concept and how it feels, the attacks, everything makes me feel like Mordekaiser, except for a spear he rarely uses.<|endoftext|>There is the Lich king from wow, Sauron, and many more that either remind us of Morde, either because of the visual design, or the character's personality and actions, like the 2 I have just mentioned.



But I wonder how much we can think of. Sauron and the Lich king are the only 2 that I can think of, but there must be other characters from a book, a movie, a tv show, maybe from a manga/anime that look or act similar to Morde.<|endoftext|>I assume conq is better for him, but is HoB any good on him, as a (fun) alternative especially since conq got hit.
What secondary runes would u go also?<|endoftext|>Hi Morde mains! I have a question about the mechanics of your R  


Afaik, all other abilities that steal stats from other champions (Trundle R and Rell passive) apply the % stat reduction as flat resistance reductions. This means that (for trundle especially), by timing an R right as an opponent like Rammus loses their insane resistances and actually goes into the negatives, while you gain insane stats from when aftershock was procced. (Example [https://streamable.com/8k3oyk](https://streamable.com/8k3oyk)).  


Does mordekaiser R work in the same way? Is it worth R'ing a tank with aftershock right before it goes away to gain the insane resistance stats?<|endoftext|>So the other day i was playing with a friend and the topic came down to QSS and how it only cleanses CC effects (he used it to try and cleanse an ignite and it didn’t work). I also said it cleanses morde R for some reason. Immediately after he said it’s because morde R is a CC effect. I said if that’s the case then tenacity should reduce it but it doesn’t. They said they’re pretty sure it does

The thing is i’ve never heard of that? Of tenacity reducing it as well. It just doesn’t make sense to me. So does tenacity actually reduce the duration? 

And if the answer is no, then i find it kinda weird how QSS can cleanse a non CC effect. Like sure counterplay to his R needs to exist but i still think it’s stupid. And I know everyone else here does as well<|endoftext|>Is ghost really good on morde jungle. Sure it has some benefits but like flash can help you on way more things ghost so I am posting this to see your guys opinions. I also lost a game where a flash could have helped me more than ghost so I'm sticking with flash but do change my mind<|endoftext|>and then I woke up... drowned in tears...<|endoftext|>So basically I just had a game where I went 5 0 in lane against a Sion, and I was pretty strong in midgame, usually getting a kill in my shadow realm then going for the rest of their team. However once everyone reached lvl 18, I dealt like my health was going down super quickly even though I built some tank items. What build excels in really late game?

My build was
Riftmaker
Nashors tooth
Spirit visage
Thornmail
Zhonyas hourglass
Gargoyle stoneplate<|endoftext|>Hi, Im a Rather tryhard mordekaiser player, who just started to climb the ladder with the Iron Revenant.
I am Currently Gold 1, And I recently reached Morde M7 at 29k Mastery Points. 

I saw that Mordekaiser suffers at early game against strong enemy laners or laners with high mobility. Since I cant reach them and they can reach me, I tend to build early tanky items such as Plated Steelcaps and Warden's Mail rather than the usual Bramble Vest against AutoAttack Dependant AD oppenents, such as Jax, Darius, Quinn, and Vayne. (Since I go for Ignite against Darius, I dont need the bramble Antiheal.) 

60 Armor, 12% Reduced AA Damage, plus extra 5+(0.35% max hp) (About 10.25 at 1500 Health, Scales with max hp, and It is huge since its calculated After the Armor and Steelcaps damage reduction!) reduced AA damage means that AutoAttacks now no longer even scratch you. You can basically Bonk them out with level 5 Qs that scale without AP Items.

And against Lilia that bitch of a deer(or any other AP enemy like Vladimir), I build Negatron Cloak and Mercury's Treads that offers 50+30MR with The Movement speed and Tenacity. 

 I started using these builds like 20 games ago and Im really getting over the lane phase especially against extremely hard / counter opponents. Tbh it feels much better to use morde as a tanker than a AP Bruiser, offering AOE Slow with Frostfire and Ulting the assassins or enemy carries away. 

What do you think?<|endoftext|>Hello again fellow Mordekaiser enjoyers and enthusiasts.

Recently, I posted about some of my Conq data, but the sample sizes were only about 5, but variance before and after patch 11.21 for Conq nerfs was quite significant.  I'd like to take this much deeper and look for input from this community!

Here is the original post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/MordekaiserMains/comments/qdva6e/conqueror_performance_data_on_morde_before_vs/

The nerf in question:
https://imgur.com/a/iq7Gilv

Since many commented about sample size, and data being from only Jungle, I wanted to reign in some ideas to be more concise.  The aim/goal here, is to determine JUST how Conqueror is performing with Mordekaiser since Patch 11.21.

The method is simple, and any ideas or help would be appreciated.  We take the Conq damage healed stat, divide by 0.09 to give "damage while Conq fully stacked", then we divide by "total damage to champs", this yields: % of stacked Conq damage

This can then be compared to Conq performance pre vs post patch 11.21 to determine if the rune is as gutted as I am starting to suspect!

So the question is: What shall I focus on!?  Here are some starter thoughts:

1. Role? Top only? Should I include Mid and Jungle?

2. ELO - should I get samples from all ELOs, or focus on Gold+, Plat+, others?

3. Morde performance - I intend to gather data from games where Morde is even or positive KDA, and to focus on longer games 20+ or 30+ minutes, to get much more fights into the data set, and to avoid games where Conq does very little and is irrelevant to the game's outcome

4. Other - any suggestions or things to keep in mind once I start seeking more data!?

I look forward to some feedback to see if I'm focusing on the right stuff, and also to help iron down what exactly are the best games to analyze!

Thanks for reading and/or helping out.<|endoftext|>I’m a new player, and I’m kind of just trying out the champs that interest me, though I’ve mostly played Garren and Urdot

Is Mordekaiser a good bot lane pick Rn? I was told he was a bot laner but I see a lot of guides saying he is top.<|endoftext|>I do not have access to the PBE, anyone can tell me or link a screenshot of how Demonic is looking in PBE ? i have seen when it was announced but i do not know if they changed stuff around.<|endoftext|>Im new to this subreddit an it seems my Build has been really wrong so could anybody give me some advice btw morde top<|endoftext|>Morde jg is slept on and it's gonna get better next patch.<|endoftext|>I played a few matches on PBE and Phase Rush might have to be the new meta for Morde.
The 3 attack/ability combo with PH and passive gives morde a lot of movement speed and kiting potential, pair this with the new cosmic drive and it’s the ultimate speed machine in the… JUNGLE!
Mythic wise is either Proto or Rift but having blue smite really amps it up to mach-10<|endoftext|>It feels like this patch totally killed him with the Goredrinker changes. I wanted Goredrinker to be nerfed because it was used by almost every ad brusier, because of it's active and it's passive and not like the Conq nerfs were that huge, but damn.


I have played Aatrox before, he was fun for me, and I still love his character, but I was fucked easily and fed most of the time. And whenever they play Aatrox I know it's an easy win because all I need is a bramble and the lane is won. And to be honest, he is a hard champ, not everyone can play Aatrox good.


At this point I either don't want to fight when there is Aatrox, or I just don't build anti-heal. I genually feel bad building anti-heal when it's an Aatrox, knowing that it's like when they build Qss against any Morde player.


And seeing the pbe item changes, it feels unfair. Aatrox just got one of his best item nerfed, meanwhile our item pool is going to get huge and great changes looking at the pbe, making Grasp even more viable for us than it is for Aatrox. I have seen Grasp Aatrox before but he hard lost and fed our entire team (I used Grasp too) (Not pbe, before Goredrinker changes)<|endoftext|>Would it sound like the Black Speech from LOTR?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2UYpY8lAhs&ab\_channel=AsherPuls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2UYpY8lAhs&ab_channel=AsherPuls)<|endoftext|>With the upcoming item changes, I think Mordekaiser will be super strong. Why? Because it will cover all of his weaknesses.

Riftmaker: The obvious go to mythic item for the omnivamp and true damage with good amount of hp and ap

Horizon Focus:  +150 hp. Now also includes **Slows** to trigger Horizon Focus. (Rylai's Crystal Scepter also works) This is a huge buff and especially good for Mordekaiser, you could even go 2nd item. Your R slows the enemy before sending them to Brazil so it applies both 10% bonus damage AND gain vision to the target which is crazy good,sometimes you would just get kited around bushes or they flashed over a wall and you wouldn't be able to see them. Vision lasts for 6 seconds and Death Realm lasts for 7 seconds (unless you trigger it again with your e or you have rylai's)

Demonic Embrace:  

* 60 Ability Power
* 450 Health
   * Dealing Ability damage burns enemies for **2/1.2% max Health** magic damage every second for 4 seconds.
   * **Convert 2% of your bonus Health to Ability Power**

A straight forward buff,the ap decrease might look like a nerf but the 2% of hp to ap makes up for it as 450 %2 is 9 ap. This item will help you get stronger with more health and most of the items Mordekaiser builds have hp including the new horizon focus. Using R on a target steals 10% of their maximum hp so you get a little AP no matter if your target is ad, and even more ap against mages.

Cosmic Drive:

* 60 Ability Power
* 250 Health
* 30 Ability Haste
* 5% Move Speed
   * After damaging champions with 3 separate Attacks or Spells, **gain 30% Move Speed** (decaying to 15%) and **40 Ability Power** until leaving combat.

This looks like if it was just made for Mordekaiser, damaging with 3 seperate attacks or spells, the same way to trigger our passive, 40 ap and 30% to 15% movement speed as long as in combat which is crazy, Mordekaiser will have so much sticking power with this item,his passive movement speed and Rylai's.

Rylai's Crystal Scepter: Will keep slowing the enemy and trigger horizon focus with any ability (including R)  and passive.

Boots: With this build you already have a lot of damage and speed so no need for sorc or swiftness. In my opinion steelcaps is better most of the time if you go legend: tenacity in the runes but sometimes mercury is the obvious go to choice.

Runes: I don't think runes need much of a change, but maybe we could switch conqueror to grasp,phase rush or dark harvest as conqueror recently got a huge nerf, these items already deal a lot of damage and provide more than enough ap and riftmaker in the late game already provides 16% omnivamp (could increase to 22% with ravenous hunter). The best runes I see are Grasp to get even tankier and a tiny bit of ap thanks to demonic, demolish cus mordekaiser lacks destroying towers, bone plating against burst or second wind if playing against a ranged top laner, unflinching for tenacity or overgrowth for hp and ap thanks to demonic. For second tree, eyeball collection and ravenous hunter for ap and more sustain.

As you see in this build, everything completes each other. Heavy damage, 1500 bonus health just with items (30 bonus ap with demonic embrace), slow, movement speed. Everything Mordekaiser needs in order to be viable,before he couldn't do all of them at once. It's unfortunate there's no zhonia's in it, i personally build zhonia in all of my games as it stops burst damage and helped me kill a lot of enemies with my passive while stasis. You could sell boots and get it as a 6th item as by then you will have decent movement speed with cosmic drive and slow with rylai's. I think Mordekaiser will be a top pick in season 12 prior to these changes,what do you all think?<|endoftext|>I've not played too many games on PBE (thanks long queue times) and of the games that I HAVE played, none have lasted into the late game proper (thanks leavers) but I've been building the same core items in more or less the same order and come up with some pretty good results.

Note: I won't be going in depth on the changes on items but will instead focus on how they directly impact our ferrous boi.

First, your options for tank Morde with the new items are a lot LOT better. Sunfire Aegis will probably be the least optimal item, but buying it solely for the increased tenacity and slow resist is still totally viable, especially if the enemy team has CC out the ass. It's less optimal because it doesn't offer a huge increase in damage overall and doesn't cover up Morde's inherent shortcomings in terms of low mobility and long base cooldowns for his abilities other than his Q. 

Frostfire's change is a straight buff to Morde, as the slowing aura now does damage directly. This means that if the enemy team is bunched up you can proc your burn damage on several of them at once. This also applies Demonic burn, which is important (I'll cover that a bit more in the section for Demonic). The slow allows you to keep up with the roughly 700 dashes and mobility options currently in the game, and makes hitting follow up Q's much much easier, especially in the Death Realm. The extra health from the mythic passive will never not be useful, and also synergizes with Demonic. 

Chemtank has a big change, and is my personal new favorite for a couple of reasons. The active allows you a pretty versatile gap closer that you can use in more situations than I can count; frontal assault, jungle gank, chasing down a squishy in your ult, etc. As well as this, the new AA empower detonates on EVERY enemy target within range, which allows you to proc your Demonic burn on a lot more targets than Frostfire. You still have to be relatively close to the targets in order for this to affect them, but seeing as this is where Morde thrives in the first place, this just makes the active much more useful. In addition to this, the new mythic passive gives you both health and CDR. It's not as much health as Frostfire, but the addition of 5 CDR can make quite the noticeable difference, especially in the late game when you can get quite a few W casts off, giving you much more endurance against fighters and tanks. 

Next are your legendaries, and I think that Demonic and Cosmic will become the new core build of Morde. Demonic now burns for 2% of maximum health if you're melee (meaning that it's even better against tanks in extended fights), but will be core for the simple reason that it's now the AP version of Titanic Hydra. Stacking tank items and getting Demonic to transform all that health into AP is an entirely viable strategy on AP bruisers like Morde, and the burn will never not be useful. In addition to this, Demonic triggers on ability damage, which Morde has in spades. In addition to his Q and passive, tank mythic burns also apply the Demonic passive, meaning you can stack up quite a few burns if you're going an AOE effect like Chemtank or Frostfire. I'd recommend this as your second item to take advantage of your tank mythic's health bonus, getting as much AP as you can early. Keep in mind that this will be your first source of real damage beyond your shards or starting item, so getting it first against really easy matchups is a hundred percent viable options. As always, knowing which items to build when is half the game.

Cosmic should almost always be your second legendary for the pure CDR and health it provides, in addition to the addition to the base move speed it now provides. Seeing as your Chemtank passive scales off of movement speed, this just adds another scaling to your overall damage, and is part of the reason I prefer Chemtank as my mythic item. This is also a viable first legendary item if you find yourself in desperate need of CDR (if you're going Sunfire, or even Riftmaker, for instance), as they've removed the AP requirement to get the full value of the item. Instead of getting a CDR boost, you get a pretty substantial movement speed and AP bonus after landing three attacks/abilities as long as you stay in combat, making you a lot harder to outrun in the Death Realm as well as making your Chemtank even more potent. 


After this, I tend to want to build tank/fighter items in order to boost your survivability to really insane levels late game. I won't cover these beyond a short blurb, as they should almost always be situational. 

Dead Man's will be an interesting item, as you'll benefit from the added mobility and the additional on-hit, but I think you'll find yourself building Bramble in most games simply due to the overabundance of healing in the game. Zhonyas is still as good an item as it ever was, but seeing as you'll be getting AP (not much, but enough) and damage from Demonic, the slot would be better used for more survivability/grevious option, and flat health AND armor is better than just straight armor if that's what you're going for. Force of Nature is now really really good and will probably be your main MR option in most games. The flat damage reduction is pretty busted, and the movement speed only makes your Chemtank hit that much harder. Visage is still gonna be a good item, and the extra shielding and healing will be better than FoN in cases where you have an enchanter on your team. Abyssal is a new option that will finally be an option on Morde, but you're going to want to get it less for the MR (which has been pretty effectively neutered) and more for the increased damage. In team fights, being at the center of the enemy team with Abyssal will be enough to pretty conclusively tip the scales in your favor, and it benefits the entire team. The real generalist/madlad options are going to be a Warmogs into Gargoyle. Gargoyle because it's just a really good item, even as a last build, and Warmogs because the only resources you need to track on Morde are health and CDR. Warmogs gives you more CDR as well as a source of infinite health keeping you out of base and in the field for whenever you see an objective up or a team fight developing

So that's my rough outline for preseason builds. None of these take friendly or enemy comp, dragon spawn, or anything like that into account, but I genuinely believe that Tank Morde will become not only viable, but the preferred build in this game that favors assassins blowing you up in about .5 seconds. Hope you have fun trying out the new items, and good luck on our eternal quest towards eliminating all life on Runterra!<|endoftext|>Which first 4 items do you think will be best on Mordekaiser on the PBE?

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/qc8wj9)<|endoftext|>The thing with season 11 messing morde up quite hard is because ad bruisers get a bunch of shiny new items, while morde has his core 2 item spike ripped apart, making one of his core items a mana item. All of that is about to change.

The addition of the bonus health conversion to ap of demonic embrace will make his late game much better, since morde is usually forced to get tank items late game, basically butchering his scalings, since ap scales on top of each other. 

the reworked cosmic drive also gives him good in combat sticking power, as 20 movement speed of the current one is quite shit.

Morde also benefits quite a bit from flat magic pen shadowflame gives, all because of his e reducing %mr, so watch out on that.

I can see a health stacking off tank bruiser build becoming meta with gargoyles stoneplate to rounf it off<|endoftext|>Its not a big shift in runes but i think It might be a pretty good thing to consider, not only for the AP conversion but just beacause It makes Morde pretty fat now that the Rune Shard Is good and Demonic almost gives 500 HP by itself, also always remember that Morde double dips on all HP beacause of his W.<|endoftext|>This item will be great for teamfights when you are against 2+ ap champions, and I think the MR shred will finally make Mordekaiser feel like a raid boss again.

Item leaks are out and the changes are really good to make mordekaiser playable. I kinda stopped playing because of how bad he is in high elo, so I mained Fiora, Irelia and Gwen. I will be back for Season 2022 and after my vacation rn, I will begin to look at the potentially new builds. If I played mordekaiser in 2021, then is was Chad Raylai’s Sunfire build. Frostfire is like really good together with new demonic, but I still believe that Sunfire can be built situationally against cc heavy teamcomps. I’m still a sucker for New Horizen Focus and Raylai’s.

I know, 75 ap isn't much and the 8% move speed wont fix him being slow, but it would help him at least a bit and the spell balde passive is a cool thing imo.<|endoftext|>So, I used to play Morde but nowadays I play other champions. With that said, I still pick Morde when I see heavy engage champions on the enemy team, like Yi, Kata, Vi, etc. And in these games I usually go tank and utility. The build goes as follows: I always start the game with dark seal, then go Sunfire Aegis (for the tenacity) then Gargoyle Stone Plate, this is where you peak, if you're fed enough you will be with 5-8 DS stacks and these two items by the 18-22min mark, and you will be unkillable while being able to solo the engage threats in your death realm, and then tank the enemy team with Stone Plate. 
One more thing, the way you want to play this build is to wait for enemy engage and insta ulti their highest threat, so they'll be locked with you on the death realm. And after that you will probably win the fight. Be ware of QSS (obviously) and play with your team, you will not be a meat shield, you will be a METAL shield for your team and be super annoying for the enemy team to deal with.
Anyways that's it, I just wanted to know if anyone plays him like I do thanks for coming to my ted talk xd<|endoftext|>My wording might hurt your eyes but please bear with me.



So I just rewatch his "behind the scenes" video and its reminded me that Riot have a concept of leaping and slam the mace on the ground, and I once have Morde rework idea that revolve around this idea of holding Q to leap in the fixed amount like Pyke but that violated Riot philosophy on classes which is "Passive, Q, W, E is suppose to be restricted by classes" and ultimate is an ability that are allowed to break class restriction (If it have a long cooldown or reasonable requirement). by letting Morde leaping slam his mace it will definitely violated Juggernaut class rules that heavily restricted mobility and trade it with high survivability and high damage output. And then this thought of changing his class hits me. What if we change his class to something like Diver? making a huge presence in the fight by slam dunking adc and take them to death realm. Funny thoughts I'd say.

But I'm well-aware that you can add skills expression or rework without changing his class entirely but this polls is meant to explore one of many possibilities.

Now I'm curious, what do you guys think?

Any detailed responses are appreciated I really want to know !<|endoftext|>

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/qa8i2x)<|endoftext|>1 more armor per level would really go a long way to not making Morde feel useless and die in 1 sec come late game. Considering he is not an early game champion, why do they refuse to give him his much needed stats back?? Elise, for example, just got her armor growth buffed to 4/level, so why is Morde's still a measly 3/level? If the balance team is worried that he will be too strong with more armor + his W, well he doesn't have access to tanky itemization like the AD bruisers so his W is all he's left with as a survivability tool. And it's one of his abilities so it takes power out from the rest of his kit, it's not like it's a free shield.

For a super slow juggernaut with telegraphed damage, not being tanky is a death sentence :(<|endoftext|>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi802rpBgb4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi802rpBgb4)<|endoftext|>So some days ago I was Playing Mordekaiser Jungle after not touching Morde for a long time this season cause I wasn’t able to get Mastery 6/7 with Mordekaiser on Top in Ranked games

Im currently stuck in Bronze (trying to master Fiora to outplay someone who took my loved Morde on top)

But as soon as I was playing some Mordekaiser Jungle I was able to get 2 S- in 2 of 3 Games wich i won easily (Finally made it to Morde M6 with 100k MP then)

Rushing The First half of Riftmaker and going Magicpen Boots is such a Powerspike that I managed to kill the whole enemy team without even having to buy Items till I had like 7000 Gold 😬

I seemed to play that well that the enemy Team even Falsly accused me of being a Platin Smurf 😂

Does mordekaiser have any other viable options of runes? the nerfs would make any rune page have a better benefit cost than precision?<|endoftext|>Very few champs in league piss me off as mordekaiser does and I am tired of it. He's not interesting to play nor is he fun to play against. When I see enemy lock-in morde I think dam this is gonna be a boring game or I happen to be playing a tank and it's Oh now I lose lane starting LVL 1 and he out scales me late game anyway. He's not an overpowered champion like irelia nor is he as trash as some of the champs this meta but riot needs to stop buffing him. He's a statcheck. The buff will either push him over the top or not do anything.

All I wish riot would do is rework his Q ability. Its the most cancer part of his kit and personally most boring. To walk into lane spamming Q on waves to then flash ulting some random person and Q'ing them to death. Just isn't my ideal fantasy of a giant metal demon monster. I'd expect morde to do some interesting things seeing he can take you to the death realm but in reality Nah. He just presses Q until your death recap tells you that he did 90% of your hp bar with a 4-second poke ability.

I personally do not have any serious suggestions but it's just how I feel about the champion and what he does for the game. I would read players' posts about old mordekaiser being skilled and I had only played him once back in the day and never understood him. But it would be cool if they would potentially try giving him back some of his skill ceilings like before.

I think mordekaisers ult currently is degenerate for the game and understandably but annoyingly cleanse cant do anything to it. I would rather them give him a polished fixed version of his old ult again but make it so he can steal your soul. The only thing I once considered was making it so that when units died a phantom version might appear with decaying hp and if he killed such phantom he gained permanent stats or temporary buffs similar to thresh or illaoi but based on damage dealt. For example 0.4% omnivamp and 0.2% increased self healing total per phantom but dependant on how much damage you've done to it. So late game with spirit visage and his items he could be rocking 30-40% omnivamp with 20-30% increased healing. And I think it would be neat in a meta where grievous wounds are 60%. Just throwing things out there.<|endoftext|>he should really have some sort of tool to break them, because once an enemy builds an edge of night item or has morgana, you're kind of just a non-champion for the rest of the game<|endoftext|>A   common wish:  After Mordekaiser uses R gain 20% movement speed for 2s

Fun fact did you know that when zed came out his ultimate could be QSSed RITO decided thats unfair and made it so u cant anymore so if they did that dont lose your hopes boys<|endoftext|> He is too easy to counter, so everyone in master+ knows what to do against him, With the old Kaiser was different because it was a different unknown champion with different mechanics, but today i think he is like a AP Darius, easily to win against, Sry about that but i miss you so much old Kaiser >:( 

Btw in the gold era of Mord i get challenger easier then today<|endoftext|>I don't care that people say that it's a bad item for him, I love it's passive, it's actually pretty funny, with a great engage potential too imo. The only thing I don't like is that I can't deal true damage with it. The ability haste after legendary items are great too imo, because I will have ult often and I can spam everything.


I still build Rift, because omnivamp and the extra omnivamp and ap after legendary items are pretty good, and dealing extra true damage is fun, and I miss them when I build NH, I can shove up the healing if they buy anti-heal, and I can't make the best out of it's passive sometimes, especially against mobile champs where NH passive is more usefull to stick onto them.<|endoftext|>For anyone who plays Morde mid, is there anything you do differently from the top lane build?

What are your counter matchup thoughts?<|endoftext|> I was playing morde for a while and never knew this was a thing or not. Today played versus wukong, I tried to ult him and during animation he cc'd me with his ult. then my ult went to cd. I was wondering if thats a bug or not?<|endoftext|>It may or may not be entirely related to Mordekaiser, but hypothetically speaking, what if there were a rune/item that would convert **50%** of bonus mana into health? For example, Liandry's Anguish gives 600 bonus mana, however its just wasted stats for morde. What if that 600 were to be converted into 300 health? 

Looking at the cost analysis on the wiki, 600 mana is worth 840 gold, while 300 health is worth 800 gold. There is a slight cost inefficiency, but if there were a way to convert bonus mana into health, how viable would the other 3 AP mythic items be on mordekaiser/other AP manaless champions?Mordekaiser would be able to also build Frozen Heart and possibly the new upcoming tank item (Archangel's Staff wouldn't work due to its item passive).

I know I'm asking for opinions, but I'm sure items like Everfrost would be nerfed immediately. Why? Because the item's total gold value is 3780, and would offer **550** bonus health on top of its other stats.<|endoftext|>

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/q5jr2k)<|endoftext|>I didn't get to play old Morde, but I looked after him, and I feel an empty space looking at the people who are complaining about his rework. Like I missed out something very good. I joined league in late 2020.


I doubt that there is much who miss the old visuals, even tho old morde was cool too (I think the coolest of the old champs), but most of is can agree that the new Morde vgu is better.



So it's probably the kit. Why does so many miss it? Okay, the ult. The old ult with the dragon and keeping the enemy's soul is cool. And old items (like old liandry) did the thing, but I still don't see why is it so missed.


I made a post before where I asked what was he like. In my other post, I got a lot of different answers, but most said that it's just that he was special in terms of gameplay, but he couldn't really fit into any position. He was a bit of everything, but couldn't really fit 1 certain role and position. Oh and I forgot that it was also said that he had a shit ton of bugs, most of them with the old ult. After all the problems he had, why? Just why? Is there something I can't see because I didn't play old Morde?

Sure, omnivamp and true damage passive is great, but I wanna microwave others and I hate cc effects on me.<|endoftext|>Pretty Much the title. Got infernal Morde in "your Shop". Is it worth it?<|endoftext|>I heard 1820 skins only go on sale once, has Project Mordekaiser gone on sale yet?<|endoftext|>Well, I once again lost my promos back to diamond to being counterpicked by this guy twice in a row. I have tried Riftmaker build and Frostfire build, but at the end of the day across at least 20 games this season I think I have maybe 2 wins against Tryndamere as Mordekaiser

I'm at a bit of a loss here. Most melee champs in the game, Morde has a clear time of strength and weakness against

Ex: Against Darius you'll get completely rekt until at least level 6 and ninja Tabis, against Jax you have the lead level 3-11 then he outscales

But Tryndamere, idk I don't know when the chance to be able to beat him and try to push a lead actually is. His pre-6 is much stronger, his ult counters Morde's ult pretty well, and he's an incredibly strong splitpushing duelist with pretty strong lane sustain.

Unlike Fiora whos sustain is based on her hitting you (so you can Bramble her), he doesn't necessarily need to hit you to sustain, oh and not to mention his Q CD is a shorter cooldown and more consistent heal than Morde's W

Morde's ult is usually good to challenge other strong duelists with, but Tryndamere can literally just go "I'm not locked in here with you, YOU'RE LOCKED IN HERE WITH ME".

Minus praying for jungle ganks, I really feel I can't do much about him.<|endoftext|>Perhaps I'm just sitting here looking at old morde through rose tinted glasses but MAN was he FUN- his bonk was 100x more satisfying than his current Q, and I really loved his old ult- you could literally walk a pet elder dragon around the map. Meanwhile his current ult is cancelled by QSS, Stun and vision drop & I can't say I feel particularly great or much more powerful after winning the 1v1 duel either with the stat steal.  


New morde visually is very impressive but I feel like his kit is so boring to use in comparison and I can't play nearly as much of it before being bored to death as I could the older kit.   
How would you guys as morde mains react if Riot were to announce that they planned to revert morde, and rebuild his old kit again from the ground up? Would you be excited or sad to see current champ go?   


Let me know if this is an awful take or not I was just curious as to how other people feel about current Morde.<|endoftext|>I started using grasp because laning feels better with it. Conq feels hard to proc until I have alacrity stacks or until I have Nashor's, and other champs who have attack speed from item (I always go Rift first) or ability (Jarvan for example) can proc it faster than me.


But I'm looking for you other player's opinions. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.<|endoftext|>I only started playing him because he is one of the few AP top lane **bruisers**, fitting into a lot of team comps by balancing out the types of damage.   
One tip I worked out with him is to play at your **effective range**, which is just **out of melee range**. This is because your Q is cone-shaped, **with the widest range being furthest away from him**, so to land it you want to be standing around a flash's distance away from the enemy. Conversely, Morde's biggest counters are those that can **stay on top of him** eg Jax, Fiora and Renekton  
Good luck to everyone playing him and have fun!

Anyhow I got bored of the classic build and tried something new.So I have this friend who can either play tank Nunu in jg or tank Yorick on top so there’s no need for me to build thornmail/spirit visage anymore because we already have a tank.So I started building full Ap, so basically my build is:

-Sorcerer’s Boots
-Nashor’s

And he trapped Veigar because he knew that since Veigar is a yordle, he is probably better at magic than the rest of the mages.

I have very strong feelings that Veigar knows some sort of Rune magic. It would explain how he can just pull out structures from the ground just like that (and the symbols on the pillars of his E if you ask me). And Morde probably learned what he could from Veigar if he had the chance.<|endoftext|>

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/pykz42)<|endoftext|>Anybody plays him jungle? Been trying it a bit (in bronce cuz I suck) but it’s been really fun. Just wanted to know if anyone plays mungle too.<|endoftext|>Before all the added mobility and damage, it was a fair nerf, but I think he needs it now more than ever. Mordekaiser used to have 3%/6%/9% MS when using his passive, but it's now stuck at a flat 3%. He needs some form of sticking power. Every other bruiser in the game has some. Darius has slows (more, now, actually, since he's getting a W buff), Sett has extra AA range and can run at you (and he's meta), but Mordekaiser doesn't get any of that. <|endoftext|>Make his ultimate ground enemies. 
This might be a bit much, but I have been playing him with ghost chemtank in the jungle and I barely can get to anyone. Thoughts?<|endoftext|>Hey, I bought the mordekaiser figurine and did not reiceve the icon even after it arriving here is there something you need to do to reedem it?<|endoftext|>Morde used to be really good in Urf I'd go like 30 0 everytime since they've reduced shielding heavily he's been a lot worse. He's THE lowest win rate champ in Urf according to a lot of websites. His W shields for next to nothing and healing is heavily reduced at the start of the game so his W does virtually nothing. So he's basically got no W for the entire game meanwhile you got Zed and Yuumi running around one shotting everyone with a 89% and 84% win rate. Riot plz fix.<|endoftext|>Hello, morde otp here 230k mastery points, right now im in silver and im a litle bit stucked there, so I wanted to know which things do the otp morde in Diamond, gold, plat,etc to Carry teammates because its frustating how Its useless for the match to win my lane if my teammates feed all enemy team, in short words I want to know which things u do to Carry and tips that u know in early, mid and late game<|endoftext|>Nothing more to add, just really happy about this achievement :D

[the video](https://youtu.be/WtXyTjntigo)<|endoftext|>I find it hard to distinguish when to take either for grievous wounds.

Thornmail:

I take thornmail when there is 3-4+ AD champions as paired up with Plated Steelcaps and Zhonya's, when building Frostfire Gauntlet (FFG) it seems to go well altogether and the thorns passive gets stronger with the armour reflect damage. An important question I have is **does Mordekaiser activate** **the immobilization effect** with his E or any other ability **to get the 60% Grievous Wounds (GW) ?**

Morellonomicon:

I heard that this item is better as no stats are wasted when you buy it and I definitely know through this item you can apply the 60% GW as you just need to get them below 50% health. I generally take this when the above does not apply or I don't need the stats thornmail offers. 



I'd like some more clarity on why people would choose one over the other. All advice and help is greatly appreciated.<|endoftext|>I finish not normally post these because I do not think they will get somewhere but an idea crossed my mind reggarding W. What if we lost the heal recast in exchange of increased spellvamp when the shield is active? This is a lot more interesting and it actually would sustain Mordekaiser giving a chance to apply more damage over time instead of just delaying his death shortly after shield is gone or bursted. It wouldn't fix the fact that it's a boring and uninteractive ability, but it would be a quality upgrade to his current W. It's either that or getting old W back because I do not see another ‏‏‎ way to make him more entertaining and skill expressive atm. I'm seriously stoked about how his tweaked passive and W will look like<|endoftext|>As we all know, Morde have receive multiple buffs, yet he still has a sightly bellow average win rate. And besides the lack of skill expression, I think one of the reasons for these results are the lack of itemization. This is the same reason that prompted riot to give Sylas and Gwen such high base stats. Goredrinker and divine sunderer are very powerful in most champions, to the point where assasins can take them and still be useful.



Riot is making new items for the preseason, I believe there are some support and tank items, yet they have said nothing about items for ap fighters. Ap fighters are mostly limited to Riftmaker/protobelt, cosmic drive, Demonic embrace and Rylai’s, with some extra flavor with Nashor’s and Zhonias. Many of these are useful on Morde, but none feels “right” (imo). This is why I think some players take Frostfire and other tank items. Ad juggernauts have plenty of options for offense and defense without ever getting out of their class items.



That said…

I don’t think Riot will make a new item for ap fighters, but even if they wanted to, how would that item look? What hypothetical item could help not only Morde, but the entire ap fighter niche? Is there such a miraculous item even possible? Also, such items should not be abused by Akali and tanks (easier said than done).



Besides discussion on current itemization, I thought it could be ***fun*** to create/imagine custom items to fill whatever hole exist on the current itemization. 

I will begin:



**Mage cleaver**. Legendary, 350 health, 60 ap, 10 ability haste. Buying this prevents you from buying Void staff.

Unique – Void: Dealing Magical damage to an enemy champion applies a stack of Grind for 6 seconds, stacking up to 5 times. Each stack reduces the target's magical resist by 4% and grants you 4 additional ability haste, up to 20% magical resist reduction and 20 ability haste at 5 stacks. 

Unique – Focus: Dealing magical damage to an enemy champion grants 3 bonus movement speed per stack of Focus on them for 2 seconds, up to 15.



**Abyssal mace.** Legendary, 400 health, 60 ap. Buying this prevents you from buying Sterak’s gauge and other lifeline items.

Unique – deathline: You deal extra true and magical damage to champions the closer they are to you, up to 10% at melee range. 

Unique – lifeline: After being in combat for 5 seconds, obtain a shield equal to 20% of your max maximum health + 30% ap for 5 seconds. 45 seconds cooldown.



Anyone has ideas? Or do you guys think there are enough items already?<|endoftext|>May I ask how to obtain the icon after purchasing the Figurine? Thank you in advance<|endoftext|>I am a jungle main and I've been playing mord jungle for a bit now and I'm wondering if he is even worth/viable to play in jungle as I've had either super fed games or super unfed games with him. If so what sort of rank could someone reach by playing mord jungle? E. Diamond, Master, Platinum etc because im looking forward for him being my new jungle main but i just dont know if its viable/worth it

thanks<|endoftext|>hi its me again, the one guy who made the post about the old morde still being technically here, AAAAAAAANYWAY, question, ignite or teleport? i usually just tp cuz i like it way more but like, looking on [u.gg](https://u.gg) all I am finding is that so many different ranks take something different, some take ignite, some TP, i usually search with "across all ranks" and yesterday it had ignite, today it has TP, its same with starter items, yesterday there was D Ring, today D Shield, its just killing my mind help pls<|endoftext|>do you think he should receive an extra passive where he converts a percentage of the mana received from items into his shield power and health? I think it would be more interesting and would increase the amount of items he would be able to make<|endoftext|>The buffs are nice compared to before, I must admit, but numbers don't lie. Morde as a champion still has a negative/unbalanced win rate despite the last few of buffs (similar to the many Nasus buffs last year). 

It's because his skillcap was removed and cc was added to his kit. He only has one combo now, for all new Morde is is a pull+bonk bot with a 1v1 button. 

Think about it. Any spell sheild (Maw, Banshees, Morgana, Mundo, ect.) removes half your kit, and remember, you only have one combo, and your pull has a long CD early. By removing his skill cap, there is no way to play around this massive flaw of the simple and mundane kit of new Mordekiaser. Between champions and items alone and their ease of access to such resources, new Morde is one of the easiest champs in the game to beat. Even if you simply play against a Morde using guerrilla warfare with short, bursty trades, since his heal is much weaker than before, all one has to do to easily beat a Morde is not fight him with his passive up. 

Ironically, QSS counterplay against Morde was more balanced on the last 2 iterations of him, as QSS fully stopped Morde's ult. New Morde's ult when QSSed still let's Morde keep the stat steal for 7 seconds, while spell sheilds put it on it's 110 second CD with nothing happening. Both Old Mordes would have the DoT and potential ghosts stopped fully, thus meaning no stat steal since no ghosts were ascertained as the ult was QSSed before they died to the curse. 

THE DIFFERENCE WITH OLD MORDE WAS THAT YOU COULD STILL USE YOUR REGULAR KIT DESPITE THE PREVAILANCE OF MANY SPELL SHEILDS AND EASY ACCESS TO QSSES. His old kit had auto resets, amping auto modifiers, half second DoT ticks that deal more damage than live, a fatter heal than full AP Sylas, passive sheilds, and stat feeding ghosts you EARNED if you won a skirmish thru skill and jukes alone. All of skill ceiling was removed when they made him only able to pull and gently bonk them and occasionally 1 v 1 them. Don't forget that his new ult has NO scaling other than cool down! 

TL;DR: The constant buffs aren't helping because Morde was given cc and had his former high skill ceiling removed. He's literally much too simple in a time where League has everyone and their mom able to have access to spell shields and QSS. Because it is so easy and common to make half of New Morde's kit useless, his winrate won't be good/balanced unless they break his numbers to compensate for how easy it is to remove half a Mordekiaser's kit in every game, which is ironically much more unbalanced than old Morde because of this fact.

Share your thoughts on my theory of why the buffs aren't helping. This seems like the logical explanation, because Morde and his items have received contact buffs, and he is STILL in the shitter. 

Smh.

Mordekiaser es Numero Uno, but God damn, Riot. It sucks having most games you play as Morde that you lose half your kit. No wonder his winrate continues to be sub par.<|endoftext|>It may seem counter intuitive but if pentakill lost chapter has taught me anything it is that mordekaiser is actually the only hope runetera has. Think about it the place is ALWAYS on the brink of destruction. The void, xerath, renekton, the darkin, aurelion sol who could just decide he has had enough and wipe out everything viego and the ruination and I'm pretty sure the yordles are up to no good never mind the constant in fighting between the different cities. The eternal world of undeath mordekaiser is trying to build is the only way to defend against all the crazy abominations that threaten runetera. Is he a narcissistic murderous sociopath? Sure. But you think the conventional good guys and leaders of runetera like Azir Kayle Garen Camille Jayce Swain and Darius aren't? Under mordekaisers initial reign of terror there was order and stability. The only reason it ended was because he decided it was time to go. And look at how crazy things keep getting in his absence. Mordekaiser is so charismatic he can even inspire the dead to his cause. Would he be a literal iron fisted tyranical monarch? Certainly. But I don't know if the current forces of runetera have anything that would be as capable of defending against void monsters and darkin as creating armies of unkillable undead metal men.<|endoftext|>* Don't have extended trades until level 3. Especially against bully lanes. (i.e. teemo, tryndamere, darius)
* Don't spam q and e whenever it's up, e combos really well with q.
* Isolated q's are really strong so battles not in lane are pretty good.
* Don't immediately ult in a team fight. Sometimes having a beefy mordekaiser frontline in the start of the fight is good.
* Ult someone who is easy to take out. (no mobility) Ulting is mostly to get the stats and keep someone from running.
* Don't immediately q in the ult. The enemy will be anticipating this. Go up and autoattack and q when the sidestep.
* Ult only when you're on top of the enemy. This is the best case scenario. Ideally passive is up too. 
* Darius is not a bad match up. Bully lanes are good for mordekaiser because they underestimate your ability to 1v1.
* If enemy is on top of you while you are hugging tower. If you ult, and they auto you, it's gg.

Overall I'm at around 55% win rate and I got M7 and I love mordekaiser. Let me know if you folks have any more tips thanks!<|endoftext|>Hello everyone, First I want to apologize for my bad english. 

I got a question, few of our memebers are posting memes where they make new mordekaiser text lines by their own and I wanted to know which effects are applied to their voices to sound that similar. For exemple, this meme ([https://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueOfMemes/comments/pre1xf/mordekaiser\_voice\_fun\_dead\_meme\_warning/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeagueOfMemes/comments/pre1xf/mordekaiser_voice_fun_dead_meme_warning/)) is pretty great ! If some of you knows which are the exact effects to add or which pich of voice should I need to imitate to sound great, it would be pretty helpful.



Ps- I'm using Audition of adobe, but I also have Audacity<|endoftext|>We should start doing bets on what the next worthless buff in gonna be, i say its gonna be a Q buff this time<|endoftext|>Am I under the impression that more often than not my team thinks i am no longer there when I ult somebody and they leave me alone because they dont see me in the map? I have found myself in this situation soo many times lately<|endoftext|>So I might get hate for this or people think of what I say is stupid but hear me out  


So first of all for clarification, the things I say can be all wrong since I am a Morde main who never got to play the old one and only looked into him trough videos and the Leage Wiki  


So like, I wanna talk about the abilities, not the looks, voicelines etc.  
To put it simple, the old Morde is still here, the abilities are still the same except that they work differently. (i am not putting the E in since that was completely changed)  


Passive: Just his W but different

Q: They just put the 3 Qs together and into a "skillshot"

W: His old passive and W combined into one and works a bit differently

R: You still take the soul, but instead you get a certain precentage of the stats instead of taking the fed ass enemy Jhin into your team (dragon removed tho)  


Unlike Aatrox, they still tried to keep the old champion in the rework, this is only what I think, so please don't go outright like "fak u ur wrong he was completely removed ur so wrong", ok<|endoftext|>

The only time I can beat him is in my ult, but even in there I can't seem to beat him in time.<|endoftext|>Wtf they gutted mordekaiser on urf wtf???? The sheild is non existent and his damage is even less prevalent.<|endoftext|>*First of all, I apologize if this is a common topic, but the most recent instance of Ryze inquiry on this sub that I've seen was posted 2 years ago.*

Anyway...

How THE FUCK do you deal with Ryze??!?

For context I was playing an ARAM game, and I didn't think much of it at first until I experienced first-hand what a Ryze OTP going Phase Rush can do. Long story short, I'm just fucking glad it wasn't an SR game because that shit was obnoxious! I was lucky to have a team to pick up my slack. We won the game, but only because Ryze's teammates played like shit.

I couldn't land a *single* ability. No, that's not right. I did land one or two there, but it was obvious that it was only carelessness on his part. Meaning, if he were a little better, he would've actually dodged a 100% of my abilities. It didn't even matter anyway, because if I could only land one ability per encounter, that is waaaay too low to be a viable trade on my part.

Speaking of trades, there *is* no fucking trading with this guy. It's all or fucking nothing! I can't land shit, but I can't run away either because of the stupidass targeted Rune Prison. ONE Rune prison is enough for him to land his full fucking combo and my life bar degrades by 70 fucking percent.

Instead of fighting him, I fought their other members, hoping that by the time my ult ended, Ryze was dead from fighting my other teammates. Thank god we had 2 hard-hitting ADCs (Draven Xayah). Whenever I saw them shit on Ryze, internally I was like "HAH! Side-step THAT, BITCH."

So I ask you, MordeMains of reddit............... HOW...?<|endoftext|>

Is this intentional or it's a bug?<|endoftext|>Trying out builds to see if Morde can be OP in URF compared to other champs or in general if we can have more fun compared to a summoner's game. All builds and ideas are appreciated! 



My experience so far:

In my first game I have tried Hail of Blades (HOB) with movement speed to see if I can whack my opponent to death quickly but it doesn't work against a team with a bunch of CC nor if I'm not tanky enough as I get bursted.<|endoftext|>I know riot has lowered the cooldown in recent patches so I was wondering if it changed the strategies for Morde. Personally, I use W  when I get low and think the enemy will try to get a killing blow. Sometimes this backfires and I get cced or too low to pop my shield before the enemy kills me. I have seen some morde players use their W shield once it is full in the beginning of a fight and sometimes are able to use it again at the end of a fight when it comes back off cooldown. 



What are your guys thoughts and tips to best use Morde's W ( for shield purposes)?<|endoftext|>The Worlds 2021 trailer have dropped not long ago. The Worlds 2021 event will have a pass. Urf is back. A lot of new and great skins will be also dropped (Nightbringer/Dawnbringer skins, Bewitching skins and World 2021 Jarvan skin). And Vex is joining the Rift soon.


And this also meanse that we are slowly getting closer and closer to the 2022 pre-season. I know, it's still far from that but I'm excited for the changes. New drake changes, the Inspiration keystone rework, new mage, tank and assasin items. I hope we will get items that are good and better for Morde. Like 1 or 2 ap healing item, or maybe the new tank items will be good for him. Or maybe we will get a use from the Inspiration keystone rework or something. Nobody knows yet.<|endoftext|>Hi guys I'm a new morde main and I love tha champ the slpas are so satisfying but my win rate is very bad with him although I dont play badly every game but I'm not level 30 yet and I guess im in bronze silver mmr so do you guys any tips for me or like areas I should focus with this champ?<|endoftext|>I was arguing with some people on how rift maker is the superior mythic for morde and how rocketbelt is situational. So out of interest, I want to know your opinion. What mythic is best for morde? I'd argue that it's protobelt without a small doubt.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/pth5cu)<|endoftext|>These kind of changes have proven to be pretty good for champions like Dianna and Tahm Kench. I feel that this change would make Mordekaiser's kit not only more similar to the classic morde but also more fun, versatile and skillfull.



**New Passive**

**Indestructable:**

**INNATE:** **Mordekaiser's** basic attacks deal 40% AP **bonus** magic damage on hit ( this is the same as now).

New:   **Mordekaiser** shields himself for x% of the damage dealt by his abilities, halved to x/2% against enemy minions and capped at y% **maximum** health.After a 1.5 seconds delay, *Indestructible's* shield decays at a rate of a% **base** health per second down to a minimum of「 y/4 % **maximum** health \].

*This is actually Iron Man, his old Passive.*

**New W:**

**Darkness Rise:**

First Activation: **Mordekaiser** deals「 5 − 15.2 (based on level) (+ 30% AP) (+ 1% − 5% (based on level) of target's **maximum** health) magic damage per second 」to all nearby enemies and gains 📷 3% **bonus** movement speed. The damage per second against monsters is capped at 180.

*This is his current passive spell, the numbers will prop be changed.*

**Recast:**  **Mordekaiser** constricts the area, dealing magic damage to all enemies near himself healing him for the same amount, from up to 2 enemies hit in their respective areas. Healing is reduced to 25% when harvesting minions.

*This is his old Harvester of Sorrow recast but only for himself. They may remove the only 2 people restriction if they can balance around it as well.*

Over the past few sets riot has been slowly adding Ephemeral (A Keyword used for ghosts and spirits) into the Noxian Gameplay segment of the pie. Leblanc's clones are ephemeral, and 2 of the new sion followers are as well. Now, for most of LoR's history ephemerals have never gone beyond Ionia (With Zed's followers) or shadow isles. There was a minor one for gameplay reasons with Azir's sand soldiers. But using it for multiple different cards from different archetypes makes it more clear that Ephemeral is becoming part of the noxian region identity. Now, which Noxian champion has very heavy ties to spirits and ghosts?   


Unless I'm wrong and they just stick him Shadow Isles because spooky champion goes in spooky region, lore be damned. But I think We've a good chance of getting him, if not as the next one, then soon after that.<|endoftext|>This is lore based, not a closed off 1v1, this means any kind of armies that a character might have by their side could be included.

Now, I know that I have to E him away from me when he jumps at me with Q + E, but its like every jax i play vs knows that, dodges it, and I get screwed.
I also know that I have to R him after he R's, but most of the time he can just outtrade me with short trades, and he won't need his R to kill me, so I have to R in defense, and he R's back in response. It seems no matter what I do I just get shredded against a jax. Any useful tips can help.

Now the God King skin idea made me interested.


But I can't honestly imagine how it would look like. The only similar things between Garen and Darius that both of them have an animal motives, Garen with the lion and Darius with the wolf, and that they have extreme shiny armors. Nothing else.


When the Darkin skin came into my mind I already had  references. The Darkins (I mean Rhaast and Aatrox. Fuck Varus) share a common theme, corrupted gods trapped in their weapons doing blood magic with red and black color themes looking like modern concept of demons. But I don't even know how to start imagine God King Mordekaiser, because there is no other reference than the idea of a shiny armor and an epic pose.



Edit: Even better idea. God EMPEROR Mordekaiser. An ultimate skin. Main colors for each look: white, black (or a darker grey), red, violet , blue, green, maybe yellow. I'm not saying orange because I'm not a fan of that color<|endoftext|>Another useless speculation post from yours truly.

**What do you guys think Mordekaiser's private Valhalla look like and what are the fates of the souls consigned there?**

**Do his cultists have a better afterlife there than his victims?**

**What does he do in his free time?**

**Does he look like his mortal self in spirit or his armored shape?**

I really want to flesh it out somewhat.

What we know is that Mitna Rachun is the plane or purgatory where Mordekaiser found himself in after his mortal death; everything there is built from souls; strongest souls are allowed to retain themselves and are conscripted in their army.

Which makes me wonder how does Mordekaiser craft without an influx of souls? My theory is that there are numerous cults dedicated to the Iron Revenant aka the Master, who carry out covert human sacrifices all over Runeterra with a magic brand, like in soul trapping in Elder Scrolls series, thus ensuring that their souls end up in Tin Man's care and subsequent reshapement.<|endoftext|>I see that everyone is building Frostfire and other tank items.

But I see that people post that they have shit ton of kills with tank items. Are tank items  that better than Ap items or something?<|endoftext|>After playing top with morde most of the time I tried jungle with conqueror, but switched to electrocute and night harvester + lich bane real quick.

During death realm you can activate chemtank for immediate 40% ms for 4 second and 50% slow for 1.5sec. FF is a slow depending on stat every 4 seconds. 

So when you think about it you cant even proc 2 slow in a death realm with ff. I think chemtank can secure a kill in death realm better than frostfire. They both have the same stats. The only down side to chemtank is the 90s cd.<|endoftext|>Basically title. Who should I look out for? Also is GP or Fiora worse?<|endoftext|>Started playing LoR a few says ago, I seem to like it. It's refreshing after so many lost game even tho I was doing good and after being griefed in Gta online.


I have already seen fan made stuff about Mordekaiser in LoR, but damn I wish he was in. I can already imagine voice lines where he roasts other champs like simp lord Viego, or having interesting lines connected to the lore, since I'm a big fan of it. Or interesting new spells.<|endoftext|>

https://reddit.com/link/ppxavt/video/a7w696qfe1o71/player<|endoftext|>Hello again fellow tincan enjoyers!

I have spent the last few days coming up with a Mordekaiser rework based on the poll on my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MordekaiserMains/comments/pnfmgp/whats_mordekaisers_identity_on_the_rift/).

The poll resulted in most people voting Mordekaisers identity to be a **mid/lategame 1v5 raidboss champion**, with a great teamfighting ability as secondary.

The comments from you guys were really helpful, giving insights about things they liked / disliked about current Mordekaiser and being generally positive, really thank you for that!

I gathered that people like Mordekaisers passive "Darkness rise" a lot and identify it as his signature part of his kit, and by extension his shield(s) (greetings from OG Morde). So I worked on this rework with that in mind and build him around his passive. So here's what I came up with and the explanation below the spell.  


[I kept his passive like it is, with the twist of removing the 3&#37; MS and adding a stacking magic resist shred with his Q. Heads up: I removed the passive &#37; shred of his E so he doesn't get overloaded with damage. General damage per second is buffed compared to live \(no numbers yet\).](https://preview.redd.it/s60ztu2qs0o71.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d50be4bc0bb390bafe57d6e3e5cd5542afa2acc)



[Same as before, with the isolated damage changed into a grounding effect for a short duration. People feel strongly negative towards mobility creep for a reason.](https://preview.redd.it/6k1hsufau0o71.png?width=515&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f2fa48f0e208ca3a57cde33da59f2aebead2b83)



[The one spell that bothered quite a lot of people since his rework dropped. Compared to old Mordekaiser this spell is underwhelming and had to be buffed several times by Riot. I changed it to be continuously shield stacking if it doesn't get broken, with a movementspeed burst at the end \(that I removed from his passive\). If the values look weak, wait until you read his ult passive. Ah, I'm also not sure yet how many seconds the shield should last, 5 is a placeholder.](https://preview.redd.it/q0g3dp0lu0o71.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=3398175ca49516820c61248902c712b00cf82dec)



[I like the spell as it is and didn't feel like it needed any changes \(except the &#37; MR pen\)](https://preview.redd.it/8dei1zgkv0o71.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=66990a6a47fde11a6c13f53e315b7298107d8d70)



[The ult passive is the reason why he scales so well into lategame, with having massive shields. The ult itself is a \(probably controversial\) prototype, since I removed his current ult despite many people liking it. I tried to recreate Mordekaisers old ult with a loss in damage, that gives him more tankiness in return. Honestly, it's the spell I will probably change completely, but since this is WIP I wanted to share it with you guys.](https://preview.redd.it/lo1teu5yv0o71.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=543772a774445eb0c690c74420cb622997d8fa6a)

Wit's end gives 40 AD + 40% AS + 50 MR. 

After level 11, Nashors needs something around 200AP+ to deal the same amount of damage as wit's end, and since many morde players play morde as a tank, I got to a thought:  


Against enemy comps with some AP damage and if you are considering to build as tank, then wit's end might deal more damage (besides, 80% ap on solo Q does only 80 extra damage per Q with 100 ap on nashors.) and provide some tankiness after all.

Lore paints him as a tyrant and a juggernaut both of will and power, unbending and seemingly unstoppable in the grand scheme of things. However, there must be some sort of analogue for him in history or fiction that would serve as base to explore the character of Mordekaiser.<|endoftext|>he kills idk nasus or something and he says "messi." like bro that's nasus not messi u got the wrong guy<|endoftext|>I TRIED to recreate the two guys pointing meme in Garry's Mod but Aatrox model didn't have any face posing functions and in-game model of league just look bad.

Now we're in the death realm he throws bombs at me but two strikes and he falls. Yuumi who was detached and hasn't grasped the situation yet was waiting for him to come out, but all she faces is a full hp Mordekaiser with a freshly renewed Ghost.

Can anyone explain to me if Grasp is better than Conq, or if it's only better in certain situations, or if it's just completely troll?<|endoftext|>Greetings fellow undead tincan enjoyers,

I'm an aspiring game dev and working on a rework idea for Mordekaiser. *I want work on this idea like the professionals, planning this rework with the community of the champ in mind*, so naturally I have to ask you guys.

First up I need to find out **which fantasy Mordekaiser fullfills** and what players think he should be able to do on the rift, working on a main ability he is shaped around. A good example of this would be Warwick: He is a wild relentless hunter, which his W exceptionally expresses due to the animations and buffs he gets. This ability alone makes Warwick really fun and engaging to play, and is the style of designing I'm trying to reproduce with Mordekaiser.



I made a poll with 5 selectable answers, including one you can select if you have any addition fantasies I did not mention. Please share those with me below, I would love to hear them! [https://linkto.run/p/M7MLMKBI](https://linkto.run/p/M7MLMKBI)



Thank you for your participation and good luck and have fun in your League games!<|endoftext|>**What makes Frostfire Gauntlet good specifically?**

I've seen on this subreddit that Frostfire Gauntlet (FFG) is used as part of your main build of items unless there are heaps of tanks or bruisers on the other team, you build Riftmaker. I try to find in-depth explanations on why FFG is good on mordekaiser but it sounds like its just stats. For clarification is FFG good on mordekaiser purely of the stats it gives because it helps him grow throughout the game or is it also the snowbind and mythic passive too and why? I see this working well with Rylais. 

**Sunfire Aegis opinion:**

Sunfire Aegis (SA) for 400g more which is the same price as Riftmaker gives you 5 more armour and MR while the two item passives together give you extra DPS to accompany you building other DPS items such as Demonic Embrace and your champion passive. The mythic passive also sounds nice too as 5% tenacity and slow resist with every finished item sounds great, especially for immobile unga bunga like Morde. 



Is picking between the two personal preference and playstyle or is one preferred over the other and why? For me I feel like SA is an better option but am open minded and am looking for the opinion of others as I'm only Silver-Gold elo.<|endoftext|>Hey guys,

That made me think "what are the other ults that Mordekaiser can cancel the same way?"<|endoftext|>Disclaimer: I'm a Gold IV, Master 7 (\~230k points on the Tin Can), and I've only been trying this build out for a few games, so yeah, I don't think it's LE GAMEBREAKING build and I believe going traditional morde is probably better most of the time. With that said.

I've been trying out a build after seeing the " Jungle Morde got Master " video, which in it the guy goes Frostfire and then a mix of tank and AP items. I tried it jungle and, you know what ? It's surprisingly good, had some good results, and some bad, I feel it's a bit reliant on your team not inting before six but then again, that's probably the case for every game of LoL.

But I then ponder, I go thonk, I look at the build and squint, can this work top as well ? The thing that surprised me the most out of this build is you barely lose any damage in 1v1, your Q does a shitton of damage by itself (something I never really paid attention to), and you're tankier earlier than with the usual riftmaker bruiser build.

Not sure if it was my inner Tank Main that woke up when I saw the build but I tried it out in a few games, and the results are pretty damn satisfying.

Runes don't change much: Conq -> Triump -> Tenacity (Or alacrity but imo Tena is better) -> Last Stand -> Conditioning (for more tank) -> Revitalize (The synergy with the bonus shield and heal is just great.)

Items I usually rush T2 boots, instead of going the Ionian boots though I try to go with tank boots, Tabi if there's AD/Auto attackers and Merc if there's AP/CC.

Then it's up to you, if you have trouble 1v1 or you're against an auto-attacker carry, go Nashor, if you're against tanks or a more mixed comp, go Demonic. Then Thornmail if you need anti heal, Spirit if there's lots of AP or you've got a heal support, and finish it up with a tank item of your choice ( Anathema, Gargoyle, FoN, Deadman, etc) or AP if you feel like you lack damage more than you do tankiness (Zhonya, Rylais, Nashor/Demonic (depends which you got earlier), Cosmic (really fun).)

Overall you forego the omnivamp and true damage from Riftmaker for a slightly tankier build with an easier time to stick with ennemies with the Frostfire passive. You can probably go any of the other two tank mythics honestly (although I feel Sunfire is a bit lackluster if you need to stick to some champion, but I can see Chemtank being good) which in my opinion, with Omnivamp having been nerfed to the ground a few patches back and anti-healing being here anyway, you don't miss that much, that and the Mythic Tank item passive DOT pairs really good with your ult.

For summs it's up to your playstyle, flash+ghost if you're confident in your lane, ghost+tp if you feel like you'll have trouble sticking to your lane, flash+tp if you want it safe.



So, thoughts ? Have I inhaled too much iron dust that I found in a brazilian back alley, or could this build actually go pretty far with some tweaking and testing ?<|endoftext|>This is my build. I would like to hear your opinions.

STARTER: Doran's ring start

Riftmaker > Plated Steelcaps/Sorcerer's Shoes > Nashor's Tooth > Spirit Visage > Rylai's Scepter > Thornmail

Bramble vest can be rushed if necessary.
Also if it goes late enough for a 6th legendary could get Rabadon's.<|endoftext|>Such as Viego and Sett R's when casted simultaneously (or even a bit later) with Morde's ult. Morde's goes on cooldown. I understand not getting the ult, it happens when you lose vision, when they dash away, get invis and so on, but putting it on CD, is it intentional or a bug? Like with Riot I never know<|endoftext|>???<|endoftext|>I personally dont level ULT after 6 since it only lowers the CD. I find it more useful to put the point in W or E.

 I mean at least make his get 1 sec longer for each level or something, or I dont know true sight?<|endoftext|>I would like to say this is not to be taken seriously this is just a build I made and has been working for me 

Riftmaker -> Cosmic Drive -> Rylais Crystal Scepter -> Gargoyle Stone plate -> with ether a Warmogs Armor or Anathema's Chains with defensive boots (Mercs or Steelcaps) 

then finish it off with elixir of Iron 
 Runes: 
Conquer 
Triumph
Legend: Tenacity or Legend: Alacrity

Second wind or Shield bash
Revitalize or Overgrowth

Today I reach you because I have something bothering me and I would like your opinion on it. Like the title is named, it's about mordekaiser mid viability. When I started playing back in season 4, I used to play morde mid a lot as it was his lane and loved it.   
Now, he got a rework for the toplane and I did tried a fews games with the new morde midlane and I have mixed feeling, perhaps lack of experience with him, wrong builing, wrong runes.

I really like the champions, whatever is the design, gameplay or lore but sadly I play mid and barely touch top. 

So I would like to ask: What do you think of his viability midlane? What runes/builds would you think work the best on him? (vs ranged and melee champ).

Hope this post won't be a bother and that you will have all a good day.<|endoftext|>

Darkness Rise-W-15 second cd. Its damage is reduced to 1 third of the current one. You can select a minion or champ and afflict them with Darkness Rise while also activating your own. Its damage and size will slowly increase up to 50% more if it is active for long enough.
You will have 9% increased movement speed for the duration. If the champs Darkness Rise is not intersecting with Mords it will only last 2 seconds and it will go on CD. If Mord has killed a target afflicted by it its CD will be reset.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/pks77k)<|endoftext|>Despite the constant buffs they’ve been giving morde, his win rate has almost never improved in diamond+. Yet due to the nature of his buffs, he’s become one of the most difficult juggernauts to face in lane. It’s gotten to the point where even lane bullies like Darius, urgot and such are struggling to beat him, when he’s supposedly at his “weakest”.

I think most of us can agree morde’s early game is not the problem, and while he does have better cool downs lategame as well as early game, I feel like one buff they can give him that might do him some good is to cause the death realm to shrink in size at level 11 and 16, giving his opponents less space to run away.

It’s not in the laning phase where morde sucks, it’s during fights where most of the time the target he ults can survive just by running away and using whatever self peel they can. Now I know we’ve all been asking for death realm to not be QSSable but obviously riots not gonna do that. So I figure the second best option is to make death realm smaller at higher ranks so he actually can do something versus getting permakited all game without Rylais.

That or bring back the 3-9% move speed  thing they nerfed to 3% way back when.<|endoftext|>Mine were probably lost chapter, Executioners calling, edge of night, and Aftershock.

Overall, I'm really liking the music, a few aren't the greatest (Conqueror, redemption, and stormrazer are a bit forgettable) but none of them are Hexcore MKII bad, which is what I was worried about. Sure the concert was Cheesy as hell, but I like cheese, it tastes good. Overall, just a good event. Morde just taking a giga mushroom and smacking Veigo's metronome was just so ridiculous it crossed over to being good.<|endoftext|>Hi everyone. Pentathony Killtano here. Long time Morde main and first time music reviewer.

In all seriousness, I'm Soko and I'm a professional musician, music teacher, long time League player, and lover of all music. Like many others, I was beyond excited for the new Pentakill release and thought I'd give my opinion on III: Lost Chapter.

This review is meant to be friendly to everyone in the community, regardless of musical background. I'm going to break down each track and rate the album out of 10 at the end of the review.

So let's begin!

III: Lost Chapter

Pentakill's long-awaited third album has finally dropped today after a fair amount of hype around the project. A note to make about this album is that it is refreshing to see incredible musicians such as Jorn Lande, Tre Watson, TELLE, and Noora Louhimo receiving some proper full credits for their outstanding work.



Lost Chapter

Title tracks for Pentakill releases have never disappointed in my opinion. It's beyond refreshing to hear Jorn Lande fronting the band again. His vocal performances always demand attention from the listeners and draws you into the narrative being set in the album. No Pentakill song seems complete now without some epic cinema string section orchestration. Overall, a promising start for the album!



Predator

I'll be totally honest, I needed to give a few extra listens to Predator to process it. After listening to the album several times over, I can confidently say that Predator is a contender for one of the top songs on the album. The aggressive intro and driving rhythm builds quite a bit of excitement as the album opens up. The important task is whether or not this excitement can be maintained to both build tension and offer releases during the track. Predator does not disappoint in the slightest. I would love to see more tracks akin to Predator in future Pentakill releases. I believe that it appropriately matches the darker image of Pentakill this time around. This track will be on repeat in my playlist for quite a while.



Edge of Night

A lone acoustic guitar guides us through the orchestral powerhouse that is Edge of Night. If you are familiar with Bo Burnham:

"Y'all want a motherfucking KEY CHANGE?!?!?"

Edge of Night utilizes key changes in the chorus to stack tension and pent up energy to be resolved by an overdriven guitar lick with violins in tandem. This track is THE most Pentakill that Pentakill could get. The guitar shredding, the huge orchestra hits, those motherfucking key changes, and memorable lyrics. It's just so Pentakill!



Gathering Storm

Noora's premier on Gathering Storm is one that keeps that metal high coming and coming. Gathering Storm doesn't lean too heavily into the orchestral parts which I think is a smart idea after having that movie trailer epic that was Edge of Night. I have nothing but great things to say about Gathering Storm and Noora Louhimo is the main reason why. Her vocals carry every bit of emotion that she's feeling in her performance and slaps you across the face with it. One of my favorite songs with Noora as a front so far from Pentakill.



Conqueror

Conqueror featuring TELLE and Tre Watson was the first song I admittedly felt that there needed to be some major change in pace for the album. Something faster, heavier hitting, a song to show off soloing capabilities, anything. Conqueror eventually gets to that change of feeling towards the end of the track with the screaming vocals and guitar solo but I feel that it could have been brought around from the beginning. Just as Conqueror gets great, it starts to fade out to the next track. A fair track by all means, but I wish I could have had more.



Executioner's Calling

Jorn and Tre join for the first time on this track. Executioner's to me has many great things going for it. But after the longing left from Conqueror, I found myself still wanting more leading into most of Executioner's Calling. The most exciting change of pace for me came from the surprising but delightful keyboard and instrumental solo break about 2:22 into the track. Hearing bands playing so deep in the pocket that you find loose change is always an exciting feeling. (For my friends that may not know, "the pocket" refers to a band playing together, in time, and synced in a way that goes beyond just written music). Also, again with the fade out! I love fades as much as the next guy, but it just didn't seem necessary.



Stormrazor

Fucking. Finally. THIS track is the type of change you want to hear in an album to keep interest! As soon as Stormrazor come on, it felt like a breath of fresh air. Faster tempo, a drum part that emphasizes that faster tempo, and some absolutely nasty shredding coming from lead guitar. Noora's vocals come through strong with it's sinister edge. The instruments help hold this track together a la Metallica. Stormrazor easily becomes a contender for top track on the album.



Aftershock

DJENT. D-DJENT. DJENT D-D-D-DJENT. Some good ol' fashioned djent never hurt nobody, bud! But if I'm being serious, I think that the djent style to Aftershock is what helps maintain the interest in the song. This isn't a bad thing by any means, but Aftershock does feel very... "same-y" compared to other tracks so far on the album.



Last Stand

Ahhh and here we are again with the epic orchestra scoring. Last Stand seems to give some finality to the close of the album. Whenever I listen to this track, I get serious flashes back to "Mortal Reminder" from Pentakill's Grasp of the Undying album. A kicking album deserves a kicking ending and I strongly believe Pentakill achieved that with Last Stand. Jorn Lande again completely owns the track by seeing this metal musical voyage to it's final destination. I found myself mindlessly head banging at this track and I loved every second. Each hit, each note of the solos, every word that came from the vocalists just seemed perfectly placed to represent this final stand.



Redemption

So... I'm gonna level with you. I'm not entirely sure how to feel about this track. The opener of this track felt like an aggressive nod to "Kickstart My Heart" by Mötley Crüe. And God damn was that an amazing thing to hear on a Pentakill album! While Jorn and Noora tear it up on vocals, that bass part absolutely slaps the soul with pure rock and roll goodness.

But - and hear me out on this - the chorus sounds like a metal High School Musical number.

I can't shake the sensation in what I'm hearing. The chorus of Redemption leans quite heavily into a major tonality rather than a minor tonality that we have become accustomed to from Pentakill. This track took Last Stand and did a fucking 360 Pop Shuvit. The chorus just sounds too much like a Broadway show tune. This isn't to say metal can't be played in major keys, it's just an odd musical choice to add to the END of a Pentakill album.

Again though, the jury is still out on Redemption. It's such a banger! But it's so weird! Music is amazing like that.



Lightbringer - Acoustic

I don't have too much to add here since this is an acoustic cover of Lightbringer. All I can say is that this was such a lovely addition. Any chance that Jorn can get to sing so exposed and emotional should be cherished. Backup vocals, subtle piano riffs, somber orchestration, this track has it all, folks.



Overall, I give III: Lost Chapter an 8/10. A truly solid Pentakill album. I just wish that some tracks didn't end up feeling like the same idea over and over.



Wow this turned out a bit longer than I thought it would be!

For those that read through and made it to the end, I greatly appreciate you my friend! This is all my own opinion, but now I want to know what you think!

What would you rate this album? What are your favorite tracks? How do you think this compares to other Pentakill albums?

Stay safe everyone, and keep rockin'!<|endoftext|>I hate playing Morde I HATE fighting and I miss my old main so much, only trumped by Aatrox for deleted champions.

Feels very powerful and you pull off really nice clutches because people dont expect them. You almost about to die? Zonya and burn them with passive.

I feel like it is nearly as grand. Any ideas for a replacement?<|endoftext|>Honestly Morde is a very fun champion, but I am fairly new to the game and if someone picks Jax, Irelia, and other cancer champs then I just lose, I can't farm because they will kill me immediately and I can't challenge because of the same reason. Does anyone have any builds or changes I can make so that I can have fun on my main again?<|endoftext|>Since I am also a Morde main, I have found myself winning almost all the melee matchups other than yone and yasuo matchup.

I was wondering if there is a melee matchup where Morde gets absolutely annihilated because Morde is a super strong pick now and I want a counter pick against him but not a ranged top laner



Edit:Also I don't like playing cancerous champs like Irelia, Camille, Fiora and Riven so if you all could suggest champions not out of these 4 it would be appreciated. Thanks<|endoftext|>I've heard that viewers will get to decide which side is going to win, not sure if that's true though.<|endoftext|>I want your guys thoughts, I was thinking what if instead of stealing when he kills the opponent until they respawn what if it was similar to chogath ult where it stacks with each kill?<|endoftext|>People are saying hes weak or bad, but hes at about a 52% win rate in plat and 55% winrate in master+. 

His gameplay is different for sure, but his old one had so many problems and couldn't be balanced. He was a melee champion who relied getting his q off to deal insane damage along with getting a ghost, but it never works because he had no gap closer, no movement speed boost and had 0 cc. It worked back then when the game was less complicated and damage was lower with less dashes, but no decent player now will ever let you get close to them with what little he had. Especially now there are far more dashes and escapes than back then. His playrate before his rework was 0.70% and sucked at every point of the game. No high level player touched him from early 2016 until his rework.

There is nothing wrong with Mordekaiser now. All this complaining going on feels like it is just for negative attention.<|endoftext|>I went 30/10/20 in an ARAM as our Iron Revenant and got my first S+. Is this good or not by your standards?<|endoftext|>I’m not usually into skins but I love this line skin spotlights Rea leased the video already, does it come out Tuesday or day after the new patch  (North America ) thanks !<|endoftext|>I'm not one for removing skill on champs if it can be helped,

BUT, it feels really clunky to just hit someone with R and not have your passive already set up and ready to go.

For a big ability that's meant to be iconic, it it should at least have your passive proc'd imo. Not at rank 1 R; that would be much, but rank 2 or 3 I think should have it.

What do y'all think? QoL or overtuned?<|endoftext|>Hey guys ! I’m a mordekaiser lover and I want to know if one of you guys know where I can find some cool mordekaiser merchandising ?
Cause I just finded crap 3d impressed figurines<|endoftext|>it gives him omnivamp, but omnivamp only has 33% of effectiveness in area damage, and since morde's pasive, Q, an E are all area attacks, does it makes sense? I've seen some dudes making full tank morde, I just wanna know your opinion, what do you guys think?<|endoftext|>Mordekaiser in game is one of the most simple braindead and straightforward champions in the game.



Mordekaiser in lore is more akin to Tywin Lannister than the random brute rapresented in game, he is feared by everyone who remembers him, he is one of the greatest minds to ever walk Runeterra, someone able to play fucking LeBlanc at her own game, yes he puts on a facade of mindless brutality to hide his true intentions and i guess you could say thats what we see in game but thats really stretching it IMO. What im getting at is that i would have liked to see more of the character in his gameplay.<|endoftext|>As stated above, im currently at work and 2 out of 2 customer-meetings are cancelled. So heres my Mordekaiser build I use 99% of the time + some adjustments you could do.

First off, I am currently Gold 3. Had to answer this question in the comments so I wanted to say it beforehand now. If youre Diamond and are searching for a build to carry you to Master, this buildpath may not be the best for you. If you like you can still try it out in a normal and see if it works for you. On Gold and below it should work perfectly fine if you know how to utilize it correctly. Thanks to u/EtherealCardiganMan for giving me this advice.

Im a Mordekaiser Mid main since 2019 and used to spam him last year, now I only play him sometimes in normals (since I usually play normals with my 4 friends and try to learn as many champs as possible, so I just play whatever I feel could be fun) and like 90% of the time in Ranked.

This season I have \~30 ranked games and 25 of them are Morde games. Im currently at a winrate of about 85%.

***My runes:***

\- **Conqueror**

\- Triumph

\- Legend: Alacrity or Tenacity (depends on the enemy team, if hard cc on 2-3+ champs take tenacity)

\- Last Stand



\- either Second Wind or Bone Plating (depends on the matchup, if its a poke champion second wind if not Bone Plating)

\- Revitalize, and theres no excuse to not use it. I get that Unflinching is a good rune and tenacity if one of the best stats if not the best in the game, but there is no reason (imo) to use it over Revitalize on Mordekaiser



As spells I usually go Exhaust and Flash. Ignite on Morde is good for early skirmishes, but falls of hard in late. Exhaust doesnt fall off and gives u the same kill pressure cuz u slow the enemy and deny them damage which is pretty strong even in late when u use it on the enemy carry.



***My Buildpath:***

Starting Items: Dorans Shield + 1 pot or Dark Seal + refillables (shield against poke)

I feel like Morde (especially on mid) has a very high chance of killing someone early when he wants to, its the same as with Darius. He doesnt lack damage at all if I can say it like that lol. So Dark Seal may be a very good investment into Meele matchups that u can win early.

\- Riftmaker with Leeching Leer as first back Item. I see so many Mordekaisers that get blasting wand early off, it hurts my eyes. If youre forced to go back before you have 1300g or get killed early, get a tome and crystal (and maybe if you need it a rejuv bead) to get your Leer next back. Leer has INSANE stats for a 1300g item and youre wasting a chance on having that brutally OP item which allows you to 1v1/1v2 and outsustain almost everyone early.

\- Sorcerers Boots when ur winning or feel like you need them (so maybe 80% of ur matches), otherwise whatever resistance boots you need

\- Ryalis secondary. This items is PEAK on Morde. The biggest issue he has is that he can barely catch up on most champs if he misses his E or if they just have too many dashes (LeBlanc, Fizz..). Ryalis is the perfect item to fix this issue with the slows, and it also gives crazy stats (90AP and 350 HP at a cost of 3000 which makes it \~96% gold efficient plus the slow effect). If you didnt know, Rylais procs on our passive. Huge value

\- Zhonyas Hourglass. The stasis is OP on Morde since he can ult someone, get his 3 stacks up and kill them, come out with the stats of the killed person and passive up, maybe stand in 4 enemys and just press stopwatch to watch them all crumble in your passive (and maybe get your w up again the ability haste helps out here too). Plus 45 Armor, yay :D

\- Now for the last 2 items comes the "get whatever you need in whatever order you need it" part. Items you should consider include:

Spirit Visage. Huge healing value with your W and Conqueror and good stats

Thornmail if you had to grab Bramble Vest earlier. Get Bramble first back against champs that depend on their lifesteal (Yone, Fiora..)

Edit: Oblivion Orb/Morellonomicon into f.E. Vladimir, since he rarely uses his AA's to trade but rather his Q's, so Bramble wouldnt be too good against him. Thanks to u/Emilobruun for pointing that out!

Demonic Embrace. Even though im not yet over the fact they cancelled the name "Azakanas Embrace" which sounds a lot cooler (not cool riot, not cool). Grab this if you need to outstatcheck your enemys Tank or you just need some more AP. Cool item, uncool name >:(

Wits End. This may sound like im insane, but Wits End is really fun on him if youre against heavy AP damage (f.E. Syndra on lane, Lillia jungle, Lux support). This item is broken rn, attack speed is always good on Morde and AP resistances are great too. Consider getting this after Leer if you want to build it, but dont cancel me if you int with it

Nashors Tooth. Selfexplainatory, good stats and Morde gets countered by most champs with higher Attackspeed so you just fight fire with lava.

Gargoyles. Purely putting this in here to avoid the "bUt GaRgOyLeS sO gOoOoOd" comments. Neat resistances and big shield ig (never built it in my whole 450k points Morde career, dont tell the tank Morde players)

And thats it. Tried explaining why you should grab what and when. If theres any confusion about anything, feel free to ask since im tired and have no idea if any on these sentences make sense.



Edit: Also, can people that dislike this tell me why? Im trying to give newer Morde players ideas on how to learn and understand the champ better. If you have any critique, im happy to hear it since I can learn from that and become better myself (as you can see in the comments).<|endoftext|>Mordekaiser died, looked around him, saw there is no god up there, thought ,,It smells like bitch here" and became the god of death<|endoftext|>Would it proc with Frostfire and/or Rylai? Cause it would be a huge morde between approach velocity's speed coupled with mordekaiser's passiv no?
It would be of course as a secondary tree, and then you could choose free boots, stopwatch or even take futurs market. 
You would loose a bit of sustain that the resolve tree gives but wouldnt it be a fair trade?<|endoftext|>When you buy Void Staff(40%pen) while having maxed out E(15%pen) you get a total of 48% pen instead of 55%. Is this a bug or am I bad at math?<|endoftext|>Just think about it, he would make a great raid boss.
Or perhaps he'll end up being the leader of some sort of undead faction? 
I could imagine that being a plausible reason we never got a follow up on his lore.
What are your thoughts on this?<|endoftext|>I recently picked up Morde and enjoy him alot. 

I see that most people take Bone plating and revitalize as secondary runes. I do like shield bash & bone plating tho. I feel like 5-10% more shield is nice, but more dmg when shielding + resitence increase seems better. Idk tho, is it worth? I could also just go for the über-shield and take shield bash + Revitalize but bone plating seems too strong to miss out on 

Do you guys prefer one or the other? Or do you take something entirely different? Like tase of blood & ravenous hunter or something like that<|endoftext|>I tried jung mord just now and went 12/7/18 

Is it really that good or<|endoftext|>Now look at what we can see on PBE. Compare it to the one we see on the picture of the Interactive album's first teaser (can I call it teaser?) and to the model we see on the latest cinematic and to the pictures of him that we can see on the previous cinematics.


The most noticeable differences are the shoulder plates. They are looking different.


I know, different renders and stuff, but it can be really confusing, especially now that they said that they wont do changes on the skin. I personally taught that they actually changed the skin when I saw the picture of him in black armor on the first teaser(?) of the jnteractive album experience.


To be honest, I prefer the render of the other models with those darker colors, but I don't like their shoulder plates. They look like big brushes on his shoulders.<|endoftext|>It's again that part of the month when I think about old Mordekaiser and how funny was him.It's that part of the month when I think about if that "mini W-Passive adjustment" + others things are gona happen. I have seen something similiar for others champs, like gp getting back some of the crit buff on his barrells + 5 barrels stacks. Or Sona getting a mini rework...

There still hope or I am just delusional?

I miss old Morde... I want to play his old kit... with his old ult and the dragon pet... the W refull and exp buff... the Q that used to bonk... the E that used to refull his shield... I miss him... during my gaming career I always went back for play some old titles like really old ones from my childhood, with Mordekaiser I can't... I know it's a meme but I'm gona link a picture with the post anyway... at least makes me smile... it makes me feel I am not the only one being a bit of delusional... I hope we can all be delusional together around this emotional bonfire that has been created by Riot... I know they did prolly for the best and I respect that... it wasnt for my best, but I hope new players are enjoying him and will enjoying him... I hope its at least worth for someonelse and I hope they will get as many memories and as much fun I got playing him. But remember you guyz if one day Riot will ever make something on one of your favourite champions, say what you think about that. I couldnt coz during that period I stopped playing, I know would've changed nothing for them, but it would've change a lot for me. I got an important lesson from life.

I wish for everyone who had endured my bad english a good day/night. And have fun in the summoner rift summoners! (I know we are not anymore "summoners" but I wanna be a delusional till the bones).

First of all my current build looks like dis : Frostfire, Nashor and then 1 AP item followed by tanky items. For boots I generally prefer tanky boots aswell.

My question is about this 1 AP item, idk what to choose. Demonic just seems underwhelming, Rylai seems overkill since I have Frostfire, and as for Zohnya I'm afraid the HP just wont high enough. Concerning Cosmic, the items seems perfect with MS+HP+AH+80AP but I'm afraid the synergy with Nashors just sucks... One wants to spam Q and the other wants to AA to death the champion infront of it. But then what to choose? Because honestly I think going 3 tank item with already Frostfire is juste not enough damage, a base of 150-200 AP seems alright since I'm hella tanky.

Concerning my choice about Frostfire it just suits my playstyle better. I love the early tanking, I love the scaling HP, I love the frozen area and I'm afraid I cant live without ChonkyKaiser.

Thanks for your time and possible replies and may Bresil be on your side 👍.<|endoftext|>I personally feel like the mythic changes are brutal specifically to Mordekaiser. If we exclude tank items, manaless AD champions get 10 mythics to work with, but Mordekaiser only gets 3. I feel like mythic items are the one thing that should not be gated by stats? If Morde can lose half his damage heavy mythics because they're not gold efficient, why do none of the AD mythics have mana in them? Seems silly that riot tried to improve build diversity this season and I feel more item gated than ever before...<|endoftext|>I am mordekaiser main 850k points and i say tank morde op

\-then it give us more attack speed and extra damage for every auto attack.

p.s. sorry for my english.<|endoftext|>If you guys saw vex trailer, in the end morde brings her to the death realm and vex says "lets meet up later".

So, it looks like vex is friends with mordekaiser, or perhaps she's a subordinate of his. This gets me excited because perhaps, they will make mordekaiser the big bad guy?<|endoftext|>Inspired by the possible rework suggestion Vars suggested in his video (link - https://youtu.be/uErFjTXp4qw)

The first rework idea is a smaller set of changes and the second is larger, inspired by his old kit in areas. The numbers and ratios are tentative by me but are obviously subject to any changes.

First Rework Idea

P - Indestructible: (35-50)% of damage dealt by Mordekaiser, reduced to 10% against minions, is converted into a shield up to (15-35)% of his maximum health, decaying after 4 seconds of not dealing damage or receiving damage from champions.

Q - Same as currently, damage changed to (55, 75, 95, 115, 135) + (60%AP) + (50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%AD).

W - Darkness Rise: Upon activation, gain a damage aura that deals (5-15) + (20%AP) + (15%bonusAD) + (1-4)%max health as magic damage per second, and 6% movement speed, for 7 seconds.
Additionally the next 3 attacks deal increased damage, the first dealing (10, 15, 20, 25, 30) + (70%AD) + (20%AP) magic damage, the second dealing (20, 30, 40, 50, 60) + (100%AD) + (40%AP) magic damage, and the third dealing (30, 45, 60, 75, 90) + (130%AD) + (60%AP) magic damage.
After the 7 second duration, or if the ability is recast, all P shield will be drained and Morde will be healed for (40, 42.5, 45, 47.5, 50)% of the shield drained. Additionally the damage aura and movement speed will be increased to 150% for 4 seconds, but Unbreakable cannot gain shield for the duration.

No cost. (17, 16, 15, 14, 13)second cooldown.

E - Same as currently, damage changed to (50, 65, 80, 95, 110) + (40%AD) + (40%AP).

R - Unchanged.

The purpose of the first rework idea is to give Morde more feel of his old kit while still retaining his new kit and the benefits of it, and giving him back hybrid scaling. Morde's current W is in a bit of a condudrum as you can never really get full benefit from it, so by switching round his W and passive, you are always benefitting fully from the shield but have to make choices with the damage aura instead, which can be used optimally. Also this brings back the 3 hit bonks of old which is nice.


Second Rework Idea

P - Same as first rework idea's.

Q - Obliterate: The next 3 attacks deal increased damage and 50 range.
1st - (10, 15, 20, 25, 30) + (30%AP) + (50%AD) magic damage.
2nd - (20, 30, 40, 50, 60) + (60%AP) + (100%AD) magic damage.
3rd - (30, 45, 60, 75, 90) + (90%AP) + (150%AD) magic damage.

No Cost. (11, 10, 9, 8, 7) second cooldown.

W - Darkness Rise: For the next 7 seconds gain 5% movement speed, (5, 10, 15, 20, 25) + (20%AP) + (20%bonusAD) + (3-7)% max health as magic damage on hit and as damage per second in a damage aura. Deals (8-25) + (30%AP) + (30%bonusAD) to minions and monsters. When this ability ends, Morde heals for (40, 45, 50, 55, 60%) of his current P shield, consuming the shield to do. This ability can be cancelled at anytime to go on cooldown.

No cost. (14, 13, 12, 11, 10) second cooldown.

E - Same as first rework idea's.

R - Mortal Coil: Mark an enemy champion for 7 seconds, dealing( (15, 20, 25) + (3%AP)%max health as magic damage initially then the same amount again over the remaining duration. If the marked enemy dies during this duration, they are summoned as a ghost by Mordekaiser, dealing (80%enemyAD) + (50%AD) + (40%enemyAP) + (30%AP) magic damage with their attacks, and retain their passive effects as ghosts. Additionally, they also benefit from Mordekaiser's passive: the shield cap being 50% of Mordekaiser's, they convert 50% of their own damage and 20% of Mordekaiser's damage into the shield.

If Mordekaiser assists in slaying a Dragon or Rift Herald, he will gain a ghost of it instead, gaining the same effects as for summoning the ghost of a champion. Dragons additionally gain a 10% movement speed boost and Heralds take their stats from their summoned form from "Eye of the Herald", but never open their "eye", attack champions more aggressively, take double damage from charging a turret, and will only charge a turret if no enemy champions are present.

Mordekaiser can never have more than 1 Ghost at a time. If a new ghost is summoned while one is already present, the previous ghost will expire upon the summoning of a new ghost. Ghosts of Dragons and Heralds can be taken even if Mortal Coil cannot be cast, i.e another ghost is already present.

Mortal coil goes on cooldown after Mordekaiser has no ghosts remaining.

If Mordekaiser uses Darkness rise while a ghost is summoned, the ghost also receives the ability for the same duration (damage aura is larger on summoned monsters).

No cost. (150, 135, 120) second cooldown.

The purpose of the second rework Idea is to take the spirit of his season 5 rework and modernise it, while still retaining the benefit of having a pull that the modern Morde brings. Wave clear does take a bit of hit by reverting his Q which the first rework avoided, but in return Morde can keep much of what made his previous kit so fun, the bonks, turning 1v2s into 2v1s, and rolling down mid with a dragon.

Unfortunately both these reworks make Morde jungle worse to some degree, maybe some additional changes to keep his clear fast and healthy might be in order.<|endoftext|>I've seen two posts about how good it is to build full tank. Both had somewhat valid claims. The thing is... The more I read both discussions the more I realized how flexible this champ seems to be. I am just starting to use him and trying to get to know it a bit better. My take is that it really really depends, not that much on "the enemy team", but how you will go around that team.

There seems to be different ways of using this champ, as a carry, with lots of damage and 1v5 potential, or as a more... Utility tank, with some damage. I guess there are both valid even against similar matchups.

To be adding something to the community, I would ask... What are your bans, against what team comps do you avoid playing and what is your go to build (with some potential changes).

Also thanks for all the support. I really feel the difference learning champs with reddit communities.<|endoftext|>I used to be a nasus OTP. I swore just stack away and I can’t be beat. But after nearing 100 games as morde with a 70% WR, level 7 mastery, multiple games with 25+ kills, and hitting my first pentakill ever today, I do have just a few questions. 


How do y’all decide when to split push, and when to teamfight?


After quite a few games that seem to be decided on my participation or split pushing, I’ve realized there’s a lot of towers left standing that could of been decided by me and my team, but at the same time team fights that could have been decided by me. What do y’all recommend doing when your team just can’t fight without you but stays in stalemates where kills are accomplished and no obj get done?


How do y’all decide when to roam, and when to decimate your laner into the ground?


I feel like there’s a lot of times where once again, I’m destroying a laner but my second towers not going down but my mid is struggling with their first and my not can’t secure a drake. Do you try to surprise TP in? Or do you try to show yourself maybe 30 seconds prior to drake spawning. It sounds stupid but 99% of games I feel like  center of the show. It may be my usual 10 kill lead but if I show up for a drake. It’s all of a sudden 3V5 in the drake pit and I can’t kill em all or eat everyone’s damage early on. 


My last big question is build. Do you guys just go as AP heavy as possible? Or do you try to balance out with some armor or MR to increase battle sustain?


I generally go riftmaker start, boots (laner situational), demonic embrace, then I start looking around to see if I build into Thor mail or spirit visage before going nashors tooth. Is this hurting me or does morde sometimes benefit sitting at 200 AP while filling out the rest of his build as health MR and/or armor considering he deals out some hefty damage regardless of Q being isolated or bonking half a team that decided to crash on my split push<|endoftext|>[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1135705517](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1135705517)

just watch this.<|endoftext|>Current W, you press w and your grey health turns into a shield. You press w again and you get half of your shield back as hp. After the recent buffs, the ability is stronger, but with current itemization options it's still pretty useless. On top of it down right being useless against people who read what items do, it also feels lame to use, its just boring.

Rework : W first cast is the same, grey health into a shield. W second cast, Morde detonates the shield doing damage (scales with how much shield he is expending) in a large aoe around him, granting him a short MS boost, and cleansing him of all CC effects.



This is essentially the current Rengar empowered W split into 2 parts. Because of that, I think we'd all be alright with a couple more seconds being added on the cd, to ensure that careful use is required in a teamfight. BUT, this would give Morde a much better chance against kiting champions. It would let him stay in the fight much more consistantly. It would give him a lot more skill expression, you can ask yourself "Do I need this shield now? Or if I detonate will I be able to clean up with that damage?" Just think: you hit ghost to rush a Vayne and she condemns you into the wall, but you're a practiced Morde main who primed his shield by using the first w cast, and as soon as he hit the wall activated that 2nd cast to cleanse, your ghost was still active and it gave you just enough time to get in range and combo her to death. Or think: you have a great teleport flank but the enemy sees you before any engage happens and dive you. Your health goes low but you cast w to shield. You're cc'd and losing the shield fast, but your team is here now, so you Cleanse yourself, do a little damage to the enemies dogpiling you, and then R the carry and let your team deal with the rest.

Big note, it might be to strong to allow the first cast of W to be used while you are CC'd, but because it is a cleanse effect, you'd of course be able to use the 2nd cast while cc'd. This is a lot of skill expression, because good morde players could use the first cast as a way to prime the cleanse if they are anticipating an oncoming cc spell. BUT they would of course need grey health to turn into a shield, before they could cleanse, likely meaning they would already be in a fight AND if they haven't shielded, they obviously cannot cleanse. This might make the ability feel janky, but this kind of use-case on an ability is what many people would call "Counter play". "Morde can't cleanse if he hasn't shielded first" = good/obvious/not so frustrating counterplay.

Edit : English, also intially thought giving him MS on the cleanse (basically giving him full empowered Rengar W) would be too much but with more thought it feels necessary so I changed the post.<|endoftext|>

I love his design, kit, lore, playstyle, etc. Hes super fun. I've been playing since last season, basically I started right when he was reworked so I never played old morde. He carried me all the way to g4 but lately, especially with the current items, it just feels horrible to play. I'll get super fed and be giga strong until the adcs build anti tank items. It's so frustrating to be miles ahead of everyone but die as soon as an adc has kracken and ldr. On top of that, morde is so slow that its not possible to outrun all these mobile champs, or catch up to them for that matter. Now I've been playing a lot more of champs like Mundo where I have a much better chance of catching people and also not being ran down.

What is it that you guys miss so much about him? The visuals? The kit?


His old voice and voice lines were pretty cool, but looking at videos, he was pretty out dated by look. I think the reworked looks and sounds better, but that's my opinion, there must be at least 1 guy who likes the old design more.


Is it his kit that you guys miss so much? What was so good about it? Did it really felt that special? What was so special about it? The Q and it's damage? The ult and the dragon passive? The old W and E? The passive maybe for anyone?


Also, I heard that he had problems with a lot of bugs, most likely because of his Ult.


Well, I hope that for those who miss him will see changes that they will like, or a champ that basically does the same or almost the same as old Morde did. Except if it's a Q change. Don't take my bonk away. But I would accept an E change.<|endoftext|>

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/peqypm)<|endoftext|>Hi guys.

I am a main mordekaiser (duh) but I'm not a fan of riftmaker. I am a platinium main Jungle with 400 games on morde with ~60% winrate on the lad. As said previously I'm not a fan of riftmaker because I find myself prefering being tankier and I have more sucess with it (PERSONNALY)

My first thing is I hesitate between mythics : Frostfire or Sunfire? While Ff is great for the slow on AA, the bonus size and health, I find the burn on sunfire simply hyper strong. Plus the extra tenacity feels really nice. Moreover, I feel like sunfire's burn is really good combined with mordekaiser's passiv. The fact that since I'm a jungler I have a lot of time around objectives seems to put an other point to the side of sunfire.

My second thing is : what after ? I like to be tanky but I am still mordekaiser. I need damage. I need THICC BONKS. I tend to go for either Zohnya second if there is a lot of AD, or Nashors to be tanky and a great duelist, or Rylai to prevent people to run away from me. Either way, these 3 items are usually in my build. But after my second item that is 100% a damage item, I hesitate between more damage or more tankyness. And thats where I block. 

If you guys could help me in terms of items it would help me a lot, thank you for your time.

-very fast clear speeds (can full clear before scuttle)
-big dueling potential, especially against melee champs
-can do objectives relatively easily
-also can 2v2 if he decides to go for a countergank
-can carry games.

The only con is ganking an ally champ that doesn't have cc (or doesn't hit the cc ability)pre 6, because it can be tricky to land your e against certain champs with dashes.

Just make him playable again or at least make something that even resembles how unique and fun he was.

I play mord mostly because of how fun he is to me. Generally, I have fun playing mord in most games. However, like the game I'm about to describe to you, sometimes you get screwed over by your teammates. 

As I lock in mord, I see our team comp has a three - man premade that consisted of a Veigar, Nocturne, and Blitzcrank. (using porofessor). I also see (through porofessor) that the enemy sett likes to roam a lot. I get an early level advantage, while our Sivir (god bless her soul) gets a triple kill at bot. The enemy sett decides to roam, so I try to punish him when he roams out to mid or bot. My veigar sees me at mid (mind you he's feeding at this point) and says to stay in my lane, which kinda caught me off guard. I was confused, like don't you *want* to shut down the sett while you can? I did take some cs, which probably was the reason he threw a fit. A few minutes later sett roams to mid again to gank with his midlaner. (veigar had a ward in the mid bushes and did not ask for any help or assistance.) I arrive a minute later just for him to ask What is wrong with me in team chat. He asks me if I've even played the game at all, which at this elo (bronze 2) wasn't too common. So instead I critique his map awareness, saying his death to the sett and midlaner was preventable. He again reminds me to stay in my lane. Sett gets fed off of mid, I stay top because "thats what mord is supposed to do." we lost pretty hard.



TL:DR Veigar gets mad at a mord main for playing the game



So back to the original question, how would one deal with sucky teammates?<|endoftext|>Lately I've been wondering what champ to play if Morde gets banned, I have M7 on a lot of champs like Aatrox, Garen, Shen, and Volibear but I don't actually MAIN them if you know what I mean.

I have been testing out the "deepfryer" build, that of what i have seen have been rising in popularity, but it doesn't really fit my taste. So here is Tank healing machine mordekaiser:

\*\*Build\*\*

The build goes in the following:

* Riftmaker
* Resistance boots (Buy whenever)
* Spirit Visage
* Redemption or Mikael's Blessing
* Thornmail
* Warmong's Armor

These items provides 800 less health, than Deepfryer, but you get more damage, 10 ability haste, more resistance, same shielding amount (not calculating Gage) and a ton of healing. I made this build, only for the reason that i dont really feel that deepfryer, is like really bad at the early game. im just asking people to just try it out in some games, like i have because i feel like it fixes some of the problems i had with the deepfryer build. I dont want to throw any hate anywhere this is solely for my enjoyment in my ranked games.<|endoftext|>Assuming what Riot said was true and gaining the champs ghost is too buggy something that would be a lot easier to implement would be allow Mord take the ghost of Dragons, Rift and Baron. Depending on which one you R you gain different effects. Which ever one you R you need to kill in the Deathrelm and they work closer to Yoricks Maiden and you can take them the next time you R someone. These ghost will gain 20% of their original stats.

If you R Herald it will be able to Ram and stun enemies while also tank for your team. It cant Ram turrets.

If you have a Dragon it will constantly slow enemies they hit and will help you push towers. 

If you have the Baron it will lower their Defenses and apply grievous wounds.

I would also give this a separate/longer CD then when Mord Rs someone else. For example if you Rd a Dragon your R will go on its usual CD but you will not be able to R another Dragon for around 10 minutes.

Keep in mind the stats and what they do would be subject to change for balance reasons. Something like this would be a lot easier to implement and maintain for a game dev. Feel free to give your ideas on what you would change about this or how you would balance it to make it work.<|endoftext|>I love Riftmaker. Its a good item. It is straight up, I believe, Mordekaiser's best item by far.   
That being said, I've been going Liandry's Anguish and I can't go back.   


All these HP stacking Goredrinking/Divine Sundering FUCKS in toplane just buckle to Liandry's. What used to be an advance test of game knowledge and skill (Ok, so I have this much vamp and conq, and they have that much and conq, and I ult them and take that much HP and stats, but they have divine sunderer and so much HP, and \*advance calculations Algebra meme\*) is now just "hahaha, burn".<|endoftext|>i can't escape from silver 2, i need some tip :'c
my user is ryuu13943 from lan<|endoftext|>Mordekaiser is one of my favourite Top champs. But recently I have been struggling to play with him.

I feel that even if I win the laning phase, in team fights I become useless and not tanky enough.

If I use my ult, many champs can use terrian and flash, or their built in dashes to run away from me and I struggle to do the difference and use my ult.

I usually Go the usual build with conqueror and resolve and rift maker first item. But Is there any other better builds ?

Is hex tech belt viable as a mythic?
Is going full tank would make me better while maintaining my effectiveness?

Any general tips on using mord right now in this meta?<|endoftext|>So I was watching a guy playing Morde who forgot his runes, and I realised he had 390 MS thanks to Magical Footwear which got me thinking, is it viable?   
Magical Footwear: Maybe you'll get it late, but it depends on your kills, and when you finish your boots, you get extra 10 MS which Morde can find usefull.  


Approach Velocity: If you manage to slow someone if you have Rylai's Crystal Scepter, it can be useful since Morde will get more easily to the target  


I was just thinking about this, what are your opinions?<|endoftext|>I’m kinda new with this champ, but I’m bronze and already have mastery 6 with him. I apologize if this is a common question in this sub. But is my lane basically screwed if the enemy builds Quicksilver Sash?<|endoftext|>Morde passive should proc on Super Minions.<|endoftext|>

There is the video (its a collection of all pentakill vids)<|endoftext|>OK, so I just was thinking about what Morde would do if he were released, and it hit me - Viego.

Viego is supposedly the true master of the black mist, which has been shown to be a mode of instantaneous transport - if I was Morde, I'd release Viego, get him to serve me, and then have the dude materialize a deadly army while I brought more troops from the hereafter, sort of like a first wave to keep people busy again.

I realize Sentinels have recruited many and restrengthened their ranks, but unlimited wraiths is still really hard to fight. 

I also feel Morde would put the kibosh down on Thresh if Mr. Hook didn't want to play by the emperor's rules, though I don't know if Thresh could defeat Morde currently.

What do you guys think? I realize this is useless lore guessing for the future, but it's fun anyway.<|endoftext|>Ideal order: 
Frostfire Gauntlet
Rylai’s Crystal Scepter
Sterak’s Gage
Gargoyle Stoneplate
Demonic Embrace (replaceable with sit. items.)

I have done no testing. It sounds funny though<|endoftext|>I often start amplifying tome and rush Rylai’s because I find the sticking power enables more effective damage rather than potential damage and sustain from Riftmaker.
I don’t see anyone doing it and Mordekaiser feels outright overpowered to me. 
I just hit Gold 4 though so if someone can explain why I’m wrong please do.<|endoftext|>I have had games where i buy it and where I don't but I still  don't know if it's a must have.

Right now tho I more and more feel like my pool of champion would be just straight better in top lane. But as said before I never really played anything but jungle. So I wanted to know if any of you guys had tips about mordekaiser toplane (match ups, when to play safe and more) since I know the champion but not laning with him. 
Thank you in advance :).<|endoftext|>Im pretty new to League, and found my self having many mains. I’ve been playing Mordekaiser for a few weeks, and found I’m pretty good at him. But i just cant seem to improve much. Any tips and tricks would be extremely helpful. Thanks!

Extra Info:

Regularly get A’s
Very good good at winning lane
Can turn ganks into extra kills<|endoftext|>So mordes ult is good for 1v1s right? It just needs to be better so how about it starts burning enemie's champions that are in it? Not for a lot of dmg just the same as ignite. Just to deal with kalista. Or if that's too op. Make his e have a shorter cd again.<|endoftext|>I was thinking of a rework to morde, and I thought of one for R that is basically the same but that steals statistics permanently, that at level 1 steals only 5% at level 2 10% and at level 3 15% doing a mordekaiser for very dangerous late game, it would be interesting<|endoftext|>Grasp + ravenous hunter

Riftmaker -> nashor --> ravenous hydra --> spirit visage --> gargoyle

Grasp helps with short early trades. When you get ravenous one q on a minion wave heals half your hp. Basic attacks heal a truck tok too due to ravenous hunter being more effective with basics (amplified by nashor).

Try it out, super fun :)<|endoftext|>Probably done times and times again so I am going to do it aswell
Morde should rest his mace on his soulder
Do you agree?

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/p6wf0n)<|endoftext|>Literally downloaded the game a few hours ago and I'm already in love with the Mordekaiser champion. It was suggested to me to head over to this sub Reddit for some advice on what to focus on when practicing as a complete novice. :)<|endoftext|>Do you guys think a god king skin would be fitting given the lore of Mordekaiser. I personally want to see it happen.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/p6e6jb)<|endoftext|>As a long time Mordekaiser main of 8 years, I went through many iterations of Morde and the many playstyles he went through. Current morde feels very lackluster when compared to the 2 Versions before him. One of the reasons I love morde was because he was nigh unkillable due to his shieldgain, almost equivalent to a shieldbow Yasuo/Yone and his consistent DPS was allowed him to solo 3 enemies at once. 

Here is my proposed changes for Morde(This is my first time posting such an idea):

Q: 
Increase base cooldown on Q. 
[New]
Q cooldown is refunded if it hits an Enemy Champion.

W:
Passive: Healing on Mordekaiser through Items, Runes or Allies is 50% effective. Instead, 50% of incoming heals is converted to a shield up to 30% Max HP which decays when out of combat down to a minimum of 5% max hp. Additionally, Mordekaiser also gains shield for 30% of Damage dealt, reduced on non-champion sources.

Active: Empowers Darkness rise, slowing enemies in the AoE, and after 2 Seconds consumes 50% of your Shield to unleash an AoE burst dealing 50% shield + 60% AP.

This change is supposed to bring back some of the old consistency of the Iron man passive while also allowing you to trade that survivability for Extra Damage.<|endoftext|>So i wana know would you guys like to keep all that is current but swap out his R for his old R i think that could work.

I remember i used to play old Mordekaiser back in the day to just have fun afther i was done with Ranked he was fun i would hit a few normals with friends. He used to be my champion i picked every time i wanted to have fun but new Mordekaiser is a lot stronger but i dont finde him as fun as he was and i think that giving him his pre rework R would be what he needs to be fun again.<|endoftext|>so, i'm thinking in made a meme with the following screenplay:

If his Q applied on-hits even if not isolated, it would have to be at a much lower % of effectiveness. Maybe like 25% or something. Idk. 

Just a thought. What do you guys think about isolated Q applying on-hits like his passive?<|endoftext|>Typical shpiel of playing Mordekaiser for a few months now and thought about what the big boy’s strengths and weakness are, and how to accentuate them while also improving his overall kit and viability. As of now, Mordekaiser is simultaneously a team-fighting juggernaut and a 1-v-1 duelist, but it honestly doesn’t feel like he excels at either. In fact, the two aspects of his character often seem to get in the way of each other. Only one of his current abilities becomes better when used in a 1-v-1 (obliterate) and his low attack speed, mediocre cooldowns, low range, and limited damage dealing options make him lackluster in team fights. To that end, this rework hopes to accentuate his ability to impact the game without being relegated to a Brazil-bot simply existing to remove the enemy ADC. 

The complete abilities are listed below, **but the proposed rework changes will be bolded.** A more detailed explanation of each ability and the gameplay ideas behind them will be at the bottom.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Darkness Rises-***

 INNATE: Mordekaiser's basic attacks deal 40% AP bonus magic damage on-hit.
Damaging basic attacks and basic abilities grant Mordekaiser a stack for 4 seconds for every enemy Champion, Monster, or **Large Minion hit, stacking up to 5 times. At 5 stacks, Mordekaiser gains Darkness Rises.** Subsequent damaging attacks and basic abilities against enemy champions and monsters refresh the duration.

DARKNESS RISES: Mordekaiser deals「 5 − 15.2 (based on level) (+ 30% AP) (+ 1% − 5% (based on level) of target's maximum health) magic damage per second 」to all nearby enemies. **Enemies damaged by this ability are slowed (10/15/20% slow at LV 1/6/11).**
**Darkness Rises enables one use of an empowered ability per ability. (QWE)**

-----------------------------------------------------------

***Obliterate-***

ACTIVE: Mordekaiser smashes the area in the target direction, dealing magic damage to all enemies within, increased if it hits only one enemy.

**Empowered Obliterate: Cast time decreased from .5 seconds to .25 seconds. Hitting a single enemy with empowered Obliterate keeps the ability empowered.** 

CAST TIME: 0.5

COOLDOWN: 9 / 7.75 / 6.5 / 5.25 / 4

MAGIC DAMAGE: 5 − 139 (based on level) (+ 75 / 95 / 115 / 135 / 155) (+ 60% AP)

DAMAGE INCREASE: 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60%

----------------------------------------------------------------

***Indestructible-***

**Indestructible Passive: Mordekaiser stores 10% of the post-mitigation damage he deals and 5% of the pre-mitigation damage he takes in a secondary resource bar.** 

**Indestructible Active: Mordekaiser consumes his resource bar to decrease the damage of a nearby champion by a percentage equal to the value of the resource bar. If multiple champions are within range, the percentage is split between all viable targets. Damage reduction lasts for 2.5 seconds.**

**Indestructible Recast: Mordekaiser consumes his resource bar to heal missing health equal to the percent value of the resource bar.**

**Empowered Indestructible: If only one champion is the target of empowered Indestructible, the damage reduction duration is increased to 5 seconds.**

**Resource Bar Max: 30/35/40/45/50**

COOLDOWN: 12 / 11 / 10 / 9 / 8

TARGET RANGE: 650

----------------------------------------------------------------

Death’s Grasp-

PASSIVE: Mordekaiser gains magic penetration.

MAGIC PENETRATION: 5 / 7.5 / 10 / 12.5 / 15%

ACTIVE: Mordekaiser summons a claw in the target direction that grants sight of the area and, after 0.5 seconds, deals magic damage to all enemies within and pulls them 250 units. **Stuns for .5 seconds if Death’s Grasp only hits one enemy.**

**Empowered Death’s Grasp: The pull effect of Death’s Grasp triggers with no delay after cast time. Hitting only one enemy with empowered Death’s Grasp refunds half the cooldown of the ability.** 


MAGIC DAMAGE: 80 / 95 / 110 / 125 / 140 (+ 60% AP)

CAST TIME: 0.25

COOLDOWN: 22 / 19 / 16 / 13 / 10

----------------------------------------------------------


***Realm of Death-***

Instantly triggers Darkness Rises at all 5 stacks (granting empowered abilities) (all other effects unchanged)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Breakdown of Darkness Rises Rework:*** 

Probably the second biggest change here. Lets start off with how the stacks work. I understand increasing from 3 stacks to 5 for activation might seem like a bit much, especially since the bread and butter combo for it is E,Q, auto. This means that you will need to land 2 more snail-slow autos in order to activate the passive, which is extra time your enemy isn’t taking that magic damage.

However, the extra legwork seemed necessary for the added benefits. First off, this rework allows for stacks to be gained from attacking cannon/super minions. This would effectively allow a Morde in lane to auto a cannon twice, get 2 stacks, then E,Q, auto the enemy laner. An added benefit of this is wave clear when a push is necessary. 

On top of that, instead of speeding Morde up by 3% (which generally feels useless to me), the passive now slows the enemy by a base of 10%, acting as a mini Rylai’s Crystal Scepter. This not only allows Morde to stick to a single target more effectively in lane, mid/late game team fights would be greatly affected by Morde restricting the movement of nearby champions, allowing ally champions to line up skill-shorts more easily.

Lastly, slowing enemies through passive makes ALL of Morde’s sluggish abilities easier to land, which in turn increases both his 1-v-1 potential and his team fighting capabilities. But the real benefit comes from his passive activation allowing empowered abilities, which stand as the core of this rework.

***Breakdown of Obliterate Rework:***

While the base of Obliterate is the same, it is the empowered version that really steals the show. Q’s biggest weakness is the cast time. A good player can sidestep Nightfall pretty easily if they know what they are looking for. To counter this, the empowered Q has a cast time that is twice as fast. Now, this may not completely change the face of a fight, but it will allow a chance for Morde to make a much more significant impact on the battle. What CAN change the face of a fight is the Q remaining empowered if landed isolated. 

If you are able to create a situation where you enter the Death Realm with an empowered Q up and ready, you will be rewarded by having no other option but to land isolated attacks. I think it is safe to say we have all been in a situation where we miss a single Q in Brazil, leading to a waste of an all ult because of Morde’s horrendous DPS. While the increased cast time will not guarantee a hit, it will make capitalizing on ult use much easier.

***Breakdown of Indestructible Rework:***

This is by far the largest change made in this rework. Gone are the days of self-shielding, which honestly sounds kind of insane since its probably Morde’s most useful 1-v-1 tool. However, I believe the alternative synergizes with his kit and identity much better.

To start, lets break down the specifics of the reworked W. Morde will store 10% of the post-mit damage he deals in his resource bar. So if you deal 300 damage, you get 30 points in the bar. Then, when you activate the ability, an enemy champion with range (same range as Realm of Death targeting) will have their damage reduced by the amount of the resource bar. So in this scenario, 30 points in the resource bar would be 30% damage reduction for 2.5 seconds.
Now, this may still seem undoubtedly worse than base Indestructible, and I get why. The shield lasts longer (4 seconds instead of 2.5), can block minion, monster, and turret aggro, and can be ramped up by Spirit Visage, runes, and support items. Heck, Exhaust does 40% reduction for 3 seconds.

However, if we think about the identity and applicability of this ability when it comes to the champion, things start to fall into place. Since this rework is focused on Morde’s ability to 1-v-1 first, then team fight as a secondary option, it is key for his abilities to focus on enemy champions rather than himself. Also, while base rework Indestructible might seem lackluster, the empowered version is the focus. In a 1-v-1 situation, empowered W will allow for 5 seconds of reduced damage (almost the entire duration of Death Realm btw). This makes Morde’s slow attacks and abilities much less of an issue during trades, since now the damage coming in can be balanced by the slow damage going out.

And from a team fighting aspect, the W rework still has viability. The ability spreads the % of damage reduction through all viable enemy champions within range. This means a 2-v-2 with full resource bar (50 points) could see each enemy do 25% less damage. If Morde has full resource bar late game (50 points), he can reduce the damage output of an entire enemy team by 10% each. Of course, this is much less valuable than targeting a single enemy champ for the entire 50%, but that is kind of the entire point. The rework is meant to incentivize 1-v-1 while still enabling team fight potential.

Of course, the drawback is that Morde is personally more vulnerable without a self-shield, but if anything, that adds balance to the kit.

***Breakdown of the Death’s Grasp Rework:***

This one seemed like a no-brainer to me. For Morde to be a champion based around isolated abilities, its kind of crazy that his ONLY crowd-control option does not reward isolated hits. For the rework, his pull now stuns if hitting only 1 enemy champion. This allows for a guaranteed Q or auto follow up, which is pivotal in the Realm of Death. This can also serve as a much more effective escape tool when using your E to flee, as now the pursuing champion will be stuck in place (if you can manage to hit it isolated ofc).

Still, as I have said before, it is the empowered E that really sells this. Death’s Grasp’s biggest weakness is its extreme telegraphing and long cast time once the claw appears. While empowered, these weaknesses are mitigated by increased speed. This allows Morde to be HIGHLY rewarded if he saves his E AFTER the engage and passive proc rather than starting the engage with E. Likewise, hitting an isolated empowered E refunds half the cast time, making it that much harder to get away from our slow hulking revenant. Heck, if you played your cards right, it can be cast TWICE in the Death Realm. 

Having a genuine CC option to both engage, fight, and disengage with might honestly be the best thing for Morde’s kit at the moment.

***Breakdown of Realm of Death Rework:***

In all seriousness, the only change that I thought needed to be made to R was simple: activate passive.  You still get all the bells and whistles of stealing stats and growing bigger, but now you are fighting at full force in a 1-v-1. This won’t change a busted matchup (if you head-to-head a fed Irelia/Fiora, you’re still gunna lose), but it will allow the ult to be used to its greatest potential. 

-------------------------------------------------------------

All in all, this rework is greatly centered around the new effects of Darkness Rises. It now takes longer to activate, which means you run the risk of putting yourself in a hole you can’t get out of before you really get going, but it also means that if you plan your engage correctly, your opponent will be slowed, your Q will be faster, your E can stun, and your W can be hyper-exhaust.

Its true, even with this rework, Morde is still a slow, kiteable, skill-shot heavy, AP bruiser with lackluster itemization. But now, his empowered abilities would be harder to read and react to, meaning much more respect would have to be paid to positioning and fighting around him.

So now finally, you can all tell me why this rework sucks and how it can be improved! My feelings are iron, and iron stands eternal.<|endoftext|>I love Morde. I have wallpaper engine. I made a Morde wallpaper. simple. enjoy

Feel free to try it because I play with this all the time. Though it works mostly against tank champions.<|endoftext|>Since I don't know when, mordekaiser seems to hit full dmg when you are standing on melee range from his Q. Its just impossible to beat now... It even hits when you are behind him.<|endoftext|>There's been a bit of buzz around the concept of a shield/heal focused support Mordekaiser build in the past week, so I thought i'd do some theory crafting as to good possible options for Morde in the support role, here goes! Asteriks will denote what I am leaning towards.

First, **Runes**. I think we have three primary options here, consisting of:

1. **Standard Morde Runes** \- **Conquerer/triumph/legend:alacrity/last stand** with **second wind/revitalize** as secondary. Its the standard, not much to say here.
2. **Tank-support Runes** \- **Guardian/shield bash/conditioning/revitalize** with **zombie ward/ultimate hunter** secondary. This one focuses more on protecting and peeling for your adc with guardian and your ult. Ulting here is going to generally be more of a defensive peeling move, as your damage is gonna be considerably lower.
3. **Enchanter runes\*** \- **Summon Aery/Nullifying Orb/Transcendance/Gathering Storm** with **shield bash/revlitalize** secondary. While this doesnt contain any inbuilt sheilding or healing for your ally, Aery will boost any that you get from other sources (such as locket, redemption, or mikaels), and in melee range will proc every 1.5ish seconds off of Darkness Rise for a decent source of damage over time. Shield bash will also be a significant source of damage independent from AP.

Second, we have **Mythics**. Again time there are three good candidates:

1. **Locket of the Iron Solari\*** \- it's cost effective, and gives a shield for teammates with no wasted stats. A solid and cheap item that benefits from heal/shield power and can proc shield bash.
2. **Riftmaker** \- all around good item, but maybe a bit too expensive for support.
3. **Imperial Mandate** \- The wasted mana regen sucks, but this item enjoys the best mythic passive in the game, and can break even with riftmaker for stat value at three other items. A solid pick for offense without having to sink as much gold as Riftmaker requires.

And now, the other items:

1. **First Back** \- **Dark Seal**. It's cheap, very cost-effective at 128%, and only gets better.
2. **Boots** \- **lucidity** vs balanced teams, **steelcaps** vs heavy phsyical, **mercury's** vs heavy magic. Same as standard Morde, really, I see no reasons why boot choice should be altered much here.
3. **Second item** \- **Redemption**. While the wasted mana regen hurts, the item is still decent, cheap, and provides an excellent active effect while also boosting Locket, Guardian, and Indestructible.  Mikaels is an alternative vs. mostly magic-damage teams, but redemption is better for general use.
4. **Third item** \- **Knight's Vow\* or Anathemas Chains**. The former lets you act as a health battery for your adc, redirecting damage to yourself that you can later heal away. The latter lets you function as a dedicated anti-carry, picking a problematic champion on the enemy team and trapping them in your ult for the length of a teamfight while enjoying an extra 30% DR against them. Both are also solid items statwise.

Whatever the particulars, I think that tank Morde is gonna work far better as a support than going for full AP, serving as a vanguard early and an anticarry late. Anyone actually tried this in a serious game, or have any input on options I'm missing/overvaluing? **Also, anyone wanna let me lose them a few games as my adc?**<|endoftext|>What if morde could move during Q cast ? (something like camille W or darius Q)

I think it would make him feel waaaay less painful to play with, and would stop the awkward moments where you need to walk into melee range and auto them to death, otherwise people just dodge Q and run away.

Riot would need to update his Q animation, but damn, his kit would feel so much smoother. And for balancing, i wouldn't mind reverting the isolated Q buffs, those were unecessary anyway.<|endoftext|>I think the item component of qss should be removed. If people want the cleanse, they need to finish the item. What this change does is it gives mordekaiser more time to R high value targets. Enemies who buy qss would have to spend the full 3k instead of 1300, thus punishing them and their itemization.<|endoftext|>Would building everfrost on mordekaiser be any good?<|endoftext|>P1 - Indestructible (today W)

P2 -  Innate: **Mordekaiser's** basic attacks deal 40% AP **bonus** magic damage on-hit.

P2 - New passive idea is that when Mordekaiser kills a  a minion or a  Jungle monster, he should enslave their souls for short time (time increase with ult lvl) and  they would attack the next target that Mordekaiser attacked or attacked  Mordekaiser. Also, they AA should deal 20%  Mordekaiser's AP as bonus magic damage on-hit. So they scale to late game.

Q -  Obliterate: cast time reduce by cooldown reduction, reduce the area of effect

W -  Darkness Rise ( today passive) would be the old W (damage over time and speed or recast for heal and burst damage)

E -  Death's Grasp

R -  Realm of Death: take out the 10% steal, give a 1%/2%/3% max healt damage as magic damage for 7s, QSS would take the target from Death Realm, but not the burn. The burn should only be remove by killing Mordekaiser or the time duration. Riot dont want ghost of the champs, soo a generic ghost for killing a range champ (like the metal banshe) and other for killing a melee champ (the iron guard). One could be a range ghost and the other a melee with diferent abilities. And dragoooooon



\------------------------

Q and W changes would give Morde more control over his damage and a better wave control pre-6. And today passive is just his old W but with out the player control. It would reward decision making by decinding when to use the abilities to engage, to punish a enemy, use to sustain, etc. Lower area of efect and fast cast time would make possible to aim for that individual damage.

Reduce de power spike on level 6 (making less cancer to fight against). More rewording to killing in the ult. More consistency late and mid game.

**Ulting yummi will be a viable strategy,** best reason

Give a incentive for de enemy to fight you and not just run away during ult.

P1 its just his W but automatic. fill the bar gain shield, shield during combat dont decay. All animations can stay the same.

P2 would make jg Morde stay viable with old W, better split push and fun (just imagine the army of slave souls attacking the enemy nexos).

And this is just gold:

Does anyone have any news?<|endoftext|>I have made a post about the 2022 preseason, but now that we have this new Thresh animation, we now have a chance of Mordekaiser's story to continue in a way or something. If you haven't seen the "Night at the Inn" go ahead and watch it, it's on the wild rift channel.


Even tho we don't know much thing about what's exactly going to happen and what to expect, we should be optimistic. I mean, if the mage items are going to be in favor for the mana using champs, we still gonna get new tank items, maybe those items will be good for Mordekaiser. And who knows, maybe the reworked inspiration keystones will turn out to be good and usefull.


And we can see that the story is still going. Thresh is in Noxus as we, maybe he will have something to do with Morde, or whatever Thresh is doing or will do, at least give hints or something. There was an easter egg of Morde in the Ruinaton event in Noxus, so we know that he is not forgotten, or at least not completely. And they promised before that LeBlanc's, story will continue and she is basically is about doing everything to not let Mordekaiser back into the world of the living.


Riot is in a must do something situation because a lot of player was not satisfied with the Ruinaton event and how they treated the lore, and there are a lot videos and clips of champs being unbalanced and op. On Tik Tok there is a bunch of Sett W clips where he get's insane amount of shield and kills full or almost full squads with his W. They must see that there are problems.


Update: The building that we have seen in the end of the new Thresh cinematic is NOT the Immortal Bastion. It's just a tall Noxian building. Necrit made a video about the cinematic and he said that the Bastion is WAY bigger than that, looks different because it has 3 pillarns and the one we have seen only have 2. And Thresh is in Southern Noxus in the animation, nowhere near the Bastion. And we still don't know why Thresh is in Noxus and where he is going.


We can only guess that he is heading to the Bastion, either because of the Black Rose with LeBlanc and Vladimir, or wants something with Mordekaiser. The Black Rose thing seems more likely to happen because in the Ruination event, one of the fetters was in their place. And also Riot promised LeBlanc's story to be continued, and this would be their perfect chance for that. But don't give up hope, it should stand eternal like iron. There are still many possibilities in the future and not much thing is confirmed yet.<|endoftext|>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ6LGrr8iEg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ6LGrr8iEg)<|endoftext|>Hey guys, I’m planning out my 5e campaign and am gonna be using a character based on Morde as one of the final bosses. It’s gonna be a level 20 encounter, but not the absolute final boss. In my campaign he’s a child of the god of death and war who was banished for stealing souls from his dad’s domain. To make a long story short, he’s back and is stealing all the souls now to conquer the world and take the place of his dad. Other than that, he’s more or less based entirely on Morde.

My question for you guys is, if you play DnD 5e, what are some tips you could give for designing him? Should I just base him off the Orcus stat block with some flavor changes? Or should I just make a whole new stat block? And what abilities should I include from his kit? Any help is appreciated, so thanks in advance.<|endoftext|>so i did a small test and with rift, cosmic, deadmans, spirit and demonic embrace. aery if you are right next to someone you will deal 400 damage within 10 seconds which is damage i didnt know aery had. in the most recent game i played i did almost 3000 damage in a 35 min game. Also very good rune to poke with and to someone who likes to run ignite like me, i can then go nimbus cloak to run people down after i poked them to no health. i just cant decide if precision secondary or domination secondary is better.<|endoftext|>In the past, I've had a pretty good time with Mordekaiser and I've always done fairly well with the champ.  But recently through top lane, it feels like I've just been flopping pretty hard with the champ.  I get bursted down pretty hard in lane phase against enemy champs like Renekton, Garen, and Jax.  I know some champs excel at short trades and Morde is very strong with long trades, but it just feels like whenever I try to force the trade from a short to a long one, I get punished more for it?  


I just don't really know what I started to do wrong.  I try to build accordingly early game against difficult matchups (i.e. building Seekers first or Ninja Tabi) but it feels like even if I try to counter build, I'm not doing the right thing.

Basically, I'm asking for tips, tricks, and how to better work through lane phase w/ Morde.<|endoftext|>So, everyone doing their versions of mini rework, but i love his kit as it is, the only thing i think could fit for him and for his theme as unstoppable juggernaut is new effect on W  
W - Active: Mordekaiser gains X amount of shield, if he doesn't recast abbility he heals for 25% of total shield(even if it brakes) at the end of duration, but if Mordekaiser recasts ability he gains 10-30 armor and magic resists, becomes unstoppable but slowes himself for 20% and increasing to 40% over 4 seconds  


My writing is a mess but hope you understand it. Maybe you have some suggestions to this, i just think that mordekaiser self slowing himself but becoming more tankier and unstoppable could make him better at 1v1 fights in close range but wouldn't make him as strong against mobile targets, this allows him to be strong in teamfights and not just stand there in cc and being bursted down in a second.  


Also we could reduce Q isolation damage<|endoftext|>No one else in this game can fulfill the power fantasy like Mordekaiser can 

He's an unstoppable machine of destruction in the right hands and I'm glad Riot made a champion to fully fit me along with my comrades who main and appreciate him. 

enough said.<|endoftext|>I made a post before but decided to delete it and make new one.


So here is what to know about the preseason for those who don't know yet:


1. They are planning to make new terrain features after a dragon dies and they are probably going to do some changes with the buffs they give.


2. There will be new support mythick items and improved mage, tank and assasin legendary items.


3. We gonna have reworked inspiration keystones and the secondary runes balance will be adjusted.


4. There are going to be objective bounties. Basically the same as champion bounties but for objectives. They are adding this because they want to give losing teams a way to come back in the game.


5. We gonna have challenges. You will be able to track and visualize these, and we gonna have a lot of different ones. Basically like eternals and mastery points.


6. There will be progression identity changes. Basically a mastery but specific to challenges.





On top of that, Pentakill will have a comeback on the opening ceremony. So fellow metalheads, we have a reason to celebrate.


Also, there was an easter egg in a kda video of kda and true damage doing a music video togehter.


I'm personally hyped because of the new items and the Pentakill comeback. I just really hope that the new items will not only favor the mana using mages. We can Always use new tank items, and since I recently started playing Zed, I can't wait for the new Assasin items.


And I can't get over the Pentakill comeback. I hope Riot will care about them as much as they did with kda. I have seen people hate on Pentakill, "Ew, PeNtAfLoP iS hAvInG a CoMeBaCk" like shush kid, talk when you have good music taste.

(I don't care how angry I will make others with this but I listened to kda and other pop musicians and bands, and kda is highly overrated.)<|endoftext|>Hello i am new and i have a few questions

Last Stand<|endoftext|>Hey, i wanna have like an idol of mordekaiser main. Do someone know such a good twitch streamer that main Mordekaiser?<|endoftext|> He is in Noxus, the Immortal Bastion is in Noxus, Thresh says he is not more bound to Shadow Isles if you take the Interactions of Mordekaiser to Shadow Isles Champions He says ''The same magic that Chains you to this Realm frees me to walk between''. So I was think if Mordekaiser contact Thresh Like the same Way he did in the first time he came to the Living Realm ''Whispering the temptations'' and enter in contact with Thresh and made a deal with Him ''I teach you how to be free of the Curse and you help me return to the Living World''. What are your thoughts on this?

PS: Sorry for the bad English.

#<|endoftext|>Just imagine that he had a little improved gap closer, where it will help him have his E not be an complete waste against high mobility champs?

I dunno, I play him and I’m average.<|endoftext|>Since Ruination & Rise of The Sentinels was a complete dogshit despite having so much potention, It got me thinking : If Riot was to do another apocalypse theme event, (and this time actually do it right), would it still consist of the "5 'random' heroes that SAVED THE WORLD" kind of shennanigans, like, finding the group, living as one and in that including all the casualties (Like Riven and Irelia here) where members would argue until they all make with each other and 'become one' or some bullshit and defeat the big bad or smth, and who would they be?
If it wasn't for Rell, there'd be speculation. But since she's literally designed to counter him, it's her who would be the main character. But to make it a 1 on 1 would kinda kill all the hype for Mordekaiser as the ultimate conqueror (especially now that Ruination was doomed), so Mordekaiser would probably, as an intellectual as he is, do some plotting to be a bit less sensitive to Rell.
LeBlanc, as the antihero, second in cast, or someone who 'seems bad but ultimately wants to save everyone' - I'm getting hella 'sacrifice at the end for the good and all meaningfull' vibes, but that would probably be her clone so yeah.
Maybe she would be the one who is the leader of the group, the one who picked up their members or smth who knows
But who would the others be? My guess would be there would be some random who is totally useless but is there for purely comedic/cute services, like Ziggs or smth, Kled, who is annoying as hell but ultimately cruital at keeping the party mentally checked or has some one time show off where he or she actually does something that saves everyone.
A big guy to accompany Rell, probably human, but then again you can't pick just anyone, it's Mordekaiser after all. I doubt people like Sett would do anything, so my first guess is Pantheon, or maybe even a more average human, idk.
Then I'd find someone like Nasus fitting, tho I have no idea how would he fit himself fighting Morde. Ryze would also be a good leader against Morde and the one who does the travelling with the group. Ryze would definitely be a really important person for that. Swain with Leblanc as well. And the rest I have no idea.
Oh, how could I have forgotten.

Edit : I also just remembered Ornn, he is supposed to be 'humanities - or rather mortals last call.
"In the wars to come, and in their aftermath, Ornn knows that the Freljord—and the rest of Runeterra—will have need of a good blacksmith."
But then again he's a literal magma giant. Pretty sure he'd one tap little Morde. To nerf Ornn to be so small or to buff Morde so heavily, not so sure about that. After all, Morde is supposed to be MORTALS Final End, not Gods(?).
And when you think about it, Riot could just pull off Sentinels all over again, with Ornn just upgrading everyones items to Godtier mode. It's not a bad idea but after this event got every hope for League out of me, I really don't want this to happen again.<|endoftext|>I have about 2100 RP remaining, and I am going to either of these two things:  


1. Buy Project Mord
2. Buy Dark Star Mord + either Infernal or King of Clubs

Is Project worth it or should I go with Option 2?<|endoftext|>Hi It's me again. 

I am evaluating on my concept of a deep-frier Mordekaiser build. This is essentially a tank build, but it also grants substantial healing and shielding capibilities all while being able to deal hella damage. The Build has been tested in a real game and it worked way too well.  


1. **The Build**

So, what is the build? Well it may sound like trolling, but we don't buy any shoes. Why? Well I'll get to the funny numbers, and thenyou will understand.

  
In terms of Runes, we go Conqueror + Triumph + Alacrity + Last Stand primary, and Revitalize + Demolish/Shield Bash secondary.  


The items are, well, funny:

*Frostfire Gauntlet* (It grants additional 100 health to all epic items and fries our enemies)

*Demonic Embrace* (anti tank tool, fries our enemies and gives bonus stats, also bonus AP)

*Spirit Visage* (health + heal and shield power - this is the item that truly starts making this build groovy)

*Sterak's Gage* (health + healing + shield - see what I'm getting at)

*Thornail* (antiheal + frying + health)

*Warmog's Armor* (a LOT of health + healing)



HEALING AND SHIELDING: With all these items, we are able to reach 5305 max HP (without potions) and a maximum base W shield of 1592. We also get 195 Armor and 128 Magic Resist. 

This is why Sterak's and Spirit's are so important. Spirit's Visage enables Sterak's to heal you substantially just from hitting 2 enemies. You also get increased Sterak shielding and your W ends up giving you over 2000 shield and an over 1000 hp Heal. Not only that, thanks to Warmog's we get to heal around 350 hp/s when out of combat. We essentially sacrifise the shoes for damage, healing and resists.

A quick summary: we get to have 5000 hp, we heal from attacking enemies AND our W AND out of combat, we get a 2000+ hp shield from W AND an 1000+ hp shield from Sterak's.



DAMAGE AND EFFECTS:

We get 179 AD and 139 AP. We deal over 600 AP damage with a single-target Q strike.

Frostfire Gauntlet slows down enemy Attack Speed, countering most ad carries and aa oriented bruisers and it fries them. Demonic Embrace is an Anti-tank tool that burns and gives you additional resists. Thornail also fries enemies and has grevious wounds. All this and we also get our passive that can deal stupid damage and is an Anti-tank tool. We effectively still counter tanks. We Can easily kill and slow down AD Carries, Assasins and even Bruisers, who can't effectively trade with someone who has so much passive damage. We also get sustain through our sterak healing and high passive hp regen.

**2. Gameplay and Tactics**

Since we don't get any shoes, we have to play smart and find ways to lock onto our enemies. E helps greately, so make sure to max R>Q > E > W.

Essentially eny trade is a lost one for any enemy melee champion, since they get moed down by our passive + the 3 frying items. If that wasn't enough, we get passive health regen and Sterak's not to mention a gigantic shield. The only scary class are mobile/slowing AD carries who can easily outmaneuver us, so either be 100% sure you can solo kill them, or don't try to fight. If the ADC is dumb / immobile they WILL die just like the rest. You can easily 1 vs 3 with this built, which I did against the enemy Camille, a fed Miss Fortune and their Jungler, without my ult. Even if low health enemies escape, there's a good chance they will just burn to death.

Your first power spike comes after finishing the 2nd iem - Demonic. You get to fry enemies, you are tanky and deal damage. Once you get Spirit Visage + Sterak's, you get the healing to which you can later add warmog. Build Thronail as necessary, It's a good item regardless, but you can replace it with somethin like Rylai's.

This build works really well in the Jungle, since you get to peacefully farm, gank and snowball while at the same time most junglers can't solo kill you. This build also works on Top Lane, but I wouldn't even try it on bot or mid.

**3. Summary**

I hope you will enjoy deep-frying the enemy Tank whilst murdering the enemy ADC. This build is really fun. I guess you could call it mathematically correct Mordekaiser. It's stupid how much you can do thanks to the Healing, Shielding and Passive Damage. You essentially become a 5000 HP MC Donald's raid boss.<|endoftext|>hey I wana try glacial augment, any primary and secondary rune suggestions to combo with it?

NEVERMIND i'm turning this into a which alternate runes have people tried and genuinely got success on mordekaiser post.<|endoftext|>I don't wanna look greedy, but I just want to play as a golden shiny robot.


Sure, we have a king in gold. But shiny golden robot :(<|endoftext|>I've felt like it's really nice to build, especially against beefier targets. Feels nicer than rift at times. 

What are your thoughts?<|endoftext|>Hello everyone,

I recently picked up Morde and I'm having a blast with the champ but I have certain aspects that I'm weak at and I wanted to get the community's opinion on it

1) Build: I know the strongest Mythic is Riftmaker currently but I wanted to know what other certain builds are viable against different combs like what to build against mostly AP champs or mostly AD champs etc and also what runes

2) in the late game I have a problem not knowing who to ult do I ult the strongest member of their team who can kill me or ult someone I can kill 

3) how to play from behind with Mordekaiser I feel like if I ever get behind I have a hard time coming back unless my laner does something stupid like fuck up a dive

4) other than warding and stuff Mordekaiser has a problem with mobility what can I do incase I get ganked do I stand my ground and fight or just try to run away<|endoftext|>Do you guys prefer the new passive and ult or old passive and ult. For those who dont know mordes old ult was "iron man" it let him store damage he dealt as a passive shield. Basically his new w but it is always on doesnt heal and doesnt store damage he takes. The old ultimate "children of the grave" marked an enemy and did damage to them over time and if it killed them mordekaiser gained a pet in the form of the slain enemy as well as some of their stats it could also be used on drag.

I was wondering what I can do in lane when the other top laner is a samira. I feel like a made the right choices, rushing oblivion orb and then plated steelcaps, THEN riftmaker, but i still ended up getting slammed anyway. Any tips would be greatly appreciated<|endoftext|>lol this isnt a discussion its juts a bait. Anyways:

Q -  Instead of the isolation damage, make it like aatrox (3 Q Casts) and old mordekaiser combined. First 2 qs are less damage but hte 3rd one is a HUGE BONK like we had except now its a skillshot!

W- Old W or like current passive that you can put on minions/ally champs and get shield/heal based on damage dealt.

E- Current E.

R- Death realm + you  mark them. If you kill the champ 1v1 in your death realm not only you steal their stats but you also control their souls as a reward for killing them (If they qss death realm the mark stays so if you kill them after they qss you still get the soul?) And bring back dragon :D HEHE XD<|endoftext|>I'm an aatrox main, our community took a big hit when rework was released, many people left and were disappointed, many people were happy because boris(that's how oldtrox fans called him) was really fun to play.

In the end, his ult ends with me dead and he with 10 hp killing me with pretty much only his passive.

Morde build was thornmail, anathema chains, spirit visage, anti AA boots, sup item and sunfire aegis.<|endoftext|>Hello, I just downloaded League yesterday and bought mordekaiser as my first champ. This question is probably asked millions of times but what items do I build on him?  + are they any tips for him.<|endoftext|>I have a lot of ideas, and some may be considered too strong and unfair I still want to share my ideas with you guys and what's your opinions on them.


The first is that his E passive is not him getting magic pen, instead it would make his basic attacks scale from AP too. Basically a built in Nashor's Tooth. The more AP he have, the bigger he hits. Of course he would deal magic damage. But I was thinking about this being a new passive, instead of the current passive he have right now.


I also have a passive idea. Every third basic attack is stronger and deal magic damage. The damage would scale with ap.


Also a new passive idea is that when Mordekaiser kills a  a minion or a Jungle monster, he should enslave their souls and for short time and they would attack the next target that Mordekaiser attacked or attacked Mordekaiser. And to be fair, they don't do anything until Morde does anything or until someone does something to Morde.they would be like Yorick's little minions but these ones fade away after some time. And don't get me wrong, I love his current passive, but some people not so much, and let's be honest, it's not the best passive out there.



I really don't want to change his Q and W. I love them personally and I think a lot of you guys too so nothing on them. But I would love to change his E, and I have an idea how. It should be that Mordekaiser smashes his mace into the ground (the way he does in the backing animation), and in a certain area, he throws the enemy units to the air and if someone stands too close they get stunned it would deal magic damage, but not a lot. It's animation would be the ground cracikng and from the cracks, glowing green and light blue light and black smoke would come out. But I don't know if it should have an animation before it goes off. If yes I don't know if he should be unstoppable during the animation. It wouldn't be very fair.


And the ultimate. Let's be honest, we can't really complain about it. But I think that instead of stealing their stats, it would be a really good change if when we kill them while they are inside, we would enslave the enemy champ's soul. Basically combine the old and the new ultimate.<|endoftext|>What would be the best build and runes for 1v9 morde Jungle ?<|endoftext|>All changes based on old Morde mixed with the new, creating more abilities to player and versatility in builds (Written based on wiki and not balanced, sorry for my bad english).

Passive: **Indestructible**

**INNATE: Mordekaiser's** basic attacks deal 40% AP **bonus** magic damage on-hit, stacking up to 3 times. Damaging **basic attacks** grant **Mordekaiser** a **stack** for 4 seconds.

The thrid stack consumes them all to gain 7 - 12% (based on level) movement speed decaying over 1,5 second and, if the target is a **champion**, **Mordekaiser** is granted a 6-11% (based on level) (+40% **bonus** AP) (+45% **bonus** AD) of his **maximum** health shield for 2 seconds. Shield cooldown: 4,5 seconds.

Q: **Obliterate**

**ACTIVE**: **Mordekaiser** smashes the area in the target direction, dealing 4-136 (based on level) (+70 / 90 110 / 130 / 150) (+60 AP) (+40 **bonus** AD) magic damage to all enemies within and applying **on-hit** and **on-attack** effects at 100% effectiveness, 40 / 45 / 50 / 55 / 60% increased if Mordekaiser have two stacks. Auto attack or *Death Grasp* animation can be canceled by *Obliterate.*

W: **Darkness Rise**

**ACTIVE**: **Mordekaiser** gains *Darkness Rise* during 5 / 5,5 / 6 / 6,5 / 7 seconds. Then Mordekaiser heals himself for 20% of the post-mitigation damage he dealt without *Darkness Rise*, 30% of the damage dealt by *Darkness Rise* and 10% of the pre-mitigation damage he takes during *Darkness Rise*. Mordekaiser can recast to finish *Darkness Rise* duration. Auto attack or *Obliterate* animation can be canceled by *Darkness Rise* cast and recast.

**DARKNESS RISE**: **Mordekaiser** deals 9-19,4 (based on level) (+45% AP) (+40% **bonus** AD) (+6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10% of target´s **maximum** health) magic damage per second to all nearby enemies. The damage per second against monsters is capped at 220.

For the next 4 seconds, Mordekaiser can reactivate *Harvester of Sorrow* to end its primary effects and trigger a secondary effect, which triggers automatically at the end of the duration. *If  activated while no allies are nearby, Mordekaiser  will highlight an  area around him and can reactivate the ability as  normal. The first  ally to come in range will automatically gain the  effect, too.*

Active  - Second Cast: Mordekaiser constricts the area, dealing magic damage  (50 / 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 (+ 30% AP)) to all enemies near himself and  his ally as well as  [healing](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Healing)   himself and his ally for the same amount, from up to 2 enemies hit in   their respective areas.

**Enemy hits gain Realm of Death visual effect (like Illaoi's Vessel)**



 

The idea is that E/Q wold still work, but Q/AA/AA/(ward)/E/R/Q/W(the ward) would be your max damage.

Armour and MR scaling to represent his ability to manipulate metal.

The R would be good in 1v1 but also in team fights

ok, so I lost my account u/NewMordeToReddit (Shouldn't have used those 10 min email things) and now this one is the one I will use from now on.

Anyway, carrying on from the [build from last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/MordekaiserMains/comments/oxbmnz/mordekaiser_ad_ap_as/), I did some testing to see which items were better for the build and got some data on the damage output with those items.

I tried the changes in practice tool (I don't want to get reported) to a test dummy with 2700 HP and 150 Armor and magic resist (because that seems average for most normal champions), I only aa the dummy for 5 seconds. So without further to-do here is some of the information I collected. I tried to make this as fair as possible, so the damage output was also rounded down. If you try this yourselves you may find different results to mine, but overall they should be similar (I would really appreciate if you could also try this and compare results, as that would make this more accurate and we will be able to find a better build to 1 shot someone!!). However, I tested this at level 11 with the full build (which isn't very accurate and that was my fault, but lets be pessimistic and say you were level 11 with full build) so you will definitely get a higher damage output since you don't usually finish the build until level 16-18.

***^(Note: I only a select few items, but I think they similar to what you would build in the original guide, and capture the essence of AD, AP and AS Mordekaiser.)***

***5 seconds of AA on the dummy with different build Damage Output at level 11:***

* Normal Build: 4700-5000 damage
* ***^(Version 1)*** Replacing Mortal Reminder with Titanic Hydra: 4100-4500 damage
* ***^(Version 2)*** Replacing Mortal Reminder with Lich Bane: 4100-4650 damage
* ***^(Version 3)*** Replacing Mortal Reminder with Deathcap: 4900-5100 damage
* ***^(Version 4)*** Replacing Mortal Reminder with Rapidfire Cannon : 4850 damage
* ***^(Version 5)*** Replacing Mortal Reminder with Stormrazor: 4900 damage
* ***^(Version 6)***  Replacing Mortal Reminder with LDR (Lord Dominik's Regards): 5500 damage
* ***^(Version 7)*** Replacing Mortal Reminder with Manamune: 4200 damage
* ***^(Version 8)*** Replacing Mortal Reminder with Bloodthirster: 4950 damage
* ***^(Version 9)*** Replacing Mortal Reminder and BOTRK with Witsend with LDR: 5300 damage

So what did we get out of this...

We got some pretty good tips for the build.

***So here is a summary of how you should play this:***

* If you don't want to die go for ***^(Version 1)***.
* If you don't want to get reported go for ***^(Version 2 or version 3)***.
* If you want to be a Wood 5 player go for ***^(Version 4)***.
* If you're up against slippery champions go for ***^(Version 5)***.
* If you're up against tanks go for ***^(Version 6)***.
* If you want to be a sociopath go for ***^(Version 7)***.
* If you want to Vladimir go for  ***^(Version 8)***.
* If you don't like this build or you're up against heavy AP go for  ***^(Version 9)***.

***Some random ranting:***

* Sorry about the long blocks of text.
* If you do play this and you win please post video of you trying it or post a photo of your damage graphs (It really helps)!!!
* If you find out some better items please leave it in the comments so other Mordekaiser's can make the enemy top get flamed by their teams for losing to this build and rage quit.<|endoftext|>Howdy! I should start by clarifying: I don’t play ranked. I just do blind and draft for fun. This are not questions to get me to gold. They’re just to support wacky fun. I just started playing Morde again after not touching him for over 5 years. The difference: I only play mid now. Any tips for what to think about/watch out for playing Morde in mid? I know it’s sub-optimal, but it’s also fun. Just asking about general dangers for going against traditional mid champs, build tips and ideas, strategies, etc. 

Thank you for any ideas!<|endoftext|>I know a lot of you are probably going to say Fiora or Vayne, wich is something I totally understand. They are fucking disgusting, but I want to know who you guys hate and why, so I know what to expext from champs that I have never played against (if someone says one), who to fear and why. And it doesn't need to be a top or mid laner, basically any champ that you hate to play against as Morde.


I personally really don't like to play against Mundo, it feels frustrating to play against him. I have played a lot against him when he was free to play, and I tried to learn what to takes against him, how to deal with him, but no matter what I did I just never had enough damage output to deal with him, and I can buy 2 anti-heal item, he just wont die with his ult, and his passive is just disgusting. It's annoying that even if I hit lv 6 before him I have to get him with my E to get rid of his passive just so he can hit me with his Q, slow me down and run away.<|endoftext|>So for instance I know that wenn Camille dodges it with r it is not on CD but when fiora w it it is on CD. How does it work for Volibear/Viego/shyvana and other unstoppable ultimates?<|endoftext|>So thinking about how moderkaiser performs in plat elo makes me kinda sad.(spolier: He is bad).  
My question in general was why does he not have a cc immunity on his w?Or at least some partial resist.For a character that walks towards you and has a very simplistic gameplan.  
That could be one of the changes to actually make him viable in higher elo.  
Any thoughts on this?

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/oy9s9o)<|endoftext|>Hey Mord mains. I was sitting up late and thinking about what it’d be like if you could recast mord’s ult to end it early. 

I feel like in some situations you may need to back out of your realm to retreat further in some situations, though I feel like it could be used in other situations too, what do you guys think? Would that be broken, unnecessary or an alright change? 

Would love to hear some thoughts!<|endoftext|>I just fought an m6 illaoi and I did a pretty good job of dodging her E(the soul grab thing) but she just did so mutch dmg I couldnt win. What do I do or build to win against her?<|endoftext|>Okay. So I was dedicated to Riftmaker recently, after hating it for a long time. Prior, I used Rocketbelt most times. I now understand why Riftmaker is so attractive.

I tried Rocketbelt again today because of an overly annoying team (Lulu, Kai' Sai, Diana, Lillia), so ya. I needed it.

But I was thinking more about it. And the Pen late game from Rocketbelt is supremely potent. It is 26 magic pen with 4 legendary items. What I've noticed is that most people avoid building MR. Even against high MR, Rocketbelt is doing work, here's a sample:

Early - 6 pen from Rocket

Mid - 2 legendaries

Late - 4 legendaries

MR in (). % is boosted dmg

Early: Top (77) - 3.51%, Avg (50.4) - 4.16%, Min (32) - 4.76%

Mid: Top (119) - 7.88% Avg (76.2) - 9.99% Min (42) - 12.70%

Late: Top (173) - 10.53%, Avg (97.8) - 15.13%, Min (38) - 23.21%

As you can see. Rocketbelt is putting in serious work all game. Particularly in average case and against squishies. But even against a tanks, it is impressive. Late game, Rocket clearly out performs Rift for raw damage, and we also get the dash which basically counters flash in the death realm (save for walls), and the extra burst. The speed allows great use of Nashor's Tooth too.

Anywho, that's my rant about Rocketbelt for the day. If there is only 1-2 tanks, I'm thinking Rocket is a far better damage boost than Rift. You can make up the sustain by stacking more HP. I like to combo with Rylai's for guaranteed speed boost, Rylai's slow, and engage!

Cheers.<|endoftext|>Say it with me! I march towards endless glory<|endoftext|># Mordekaiser - The Iron Elo Revenant (Fun Only)

i don\`t know what to get<|endoftext|>I have been building this item on Morde 2nd after Riftmaker and boots lately (usually after rushing some other component I need first, such as oblivion orb) and it is just so, so good. If there are bruisers you need to fight against or a target you absolutely need to eliminate in your sex dungeon, or if everyone seems to have a dash... buy this item!  I am not saying it's a panacea and and it's definitely not always a must have item. But it is really, really so much better than demonic embrace (and even rylai's) and enables Morde to snowball hard or kill annoying opponents that dodge your q. Especially with so many %hp items and abilities running around, the pure HP stats from stuff like demonic and rylai's are less valuable than they might seem.  


This is low plat elo so please, take everything I say with a grain of massive salt, maybe I just faced bad opponents. But I swear I have won games that would have probably been a loss with demonic or rylais simply because the unavoidable aa damage with it is insane and can really shut a carry down. After nashor's, it's a good idea to build defensively. Randuin's, Visage, Zhonya's etc etc  depending on what you need because morde definitely wants hp and tanky stats to survive. So I don't personally recommend full ap/mostly full ap builds.  


That is all, thank you for reading if you did. Spoken as someone who used to build rylai's 2nd item a lot of the time.<|endoftext|>I got kind of excessive and bought tabi, bramble, and wardens mail against him.

nerfs: remove all of his q buffs, i didnt ask for a 1 shot flash q champ. 

buffs: 

morde passively converts ad to ap when gained from items with a loss in gold value. kinda like pyke passve but you can now buy steraks, just not make him a full ad champ

his passive instead of giving him ms now STEALS some ms from the enemy, and stacks on multiple enemies at 33% effectiveness, they still get slowed but morde does not become hecarim when his passive is on 5 people

q cast time scales with attack speed and when he hits an enemy champion he siphons some of their life, healing him for a bit of missing health.

his w now gives him resistances when t he shield is active, so he can turn fights better. and the w heal scales with missing health like voli w.

his e now is like taric stun, you can move when casting it. but the cast time is longer and when the claw shoots out enemies get slowed, not the pull, the claw

R now instead of flat 10% at all ranks steals 8/10/12%<|endoftext|>I'm not trying to bash his current kit, this was just a small idea I thought up that I felt sort of lined up with old Mordekaiser to some degree.

Passive: Instead of 3% move speed, 3 attacks and/or abilites on ONE enemy champion causes Mordekaiser to steal a percent of the movement speed of said enemy. This effect has a cooldown so you aren't stealing everyone's movement speed at once, think it might be too OP. If multiple champions are hit, it will take from the champion with the currently highest movement speed.

Death metal ring is removed and put onto W.

Q: Same as usual. I like the bonk.

W: Becomes a toggle with certain effects; Death metal ring is active, and any damage dealt while this ability is active turns into a shield. On the downside, a percentage of health is drained every second this ability is active. 

E: Also same as usual. 

R: Ability by itself seems fine, but maybe instead of a temporary 10%, a permanent 1/2/3%? Seems kind of OP so would probably remain the same. 

Most of this new idea focuses on the change of W as well as increasing his sticking power in lane and in Brazil. I have no idea about the damage numbers currently, and I would also love to hear your guy's opinions and criticisms.<|endoftext|>So, the fantasy of Mordekaiser is meant to be of a seemingly unstoppable juggernaut, bearing down on enemies with a sense of inevitability. In practice, however, outside of death realm he is incredibly easy to escape for champions with any kind of built in mobility. To both buff Morde and try to bring him closer to the concept, I propose the following simple addition to his passive:

No Escape: while within the area of Darkness Rise, enemy champions are grounded.

Would this be a good change to help fix his current problems without going overboard?<|endoftext|>What do you think?
Ive been into jungle morde lately. Here are the personal pros and cons of playing it in SR for about 10 games. Elo is KR Gold. Plz leave a comment about your opinion.

Build : FFG->Zhonya->(Cosmic Drive or Spirit Visage or Thornmail)-> Two tank items or CD items or Rylai's sceptor if u need some more damage.

Cons: Bad ganks and so-so engagements if u cant proc passive fast enough pre-Frostfire Gauntlet.
Your lanes can be destroyed by counters like Xin Zhao and Lee Sin. (But if you use your pings properly, such ganks may be prevented.)
Bad mobility, cant do much against shadow assassin Kayn. Really sucks to be wobbling around at 400 MS while Kayn flies around the map.
Is countered quite a lot against Serpent's Fang. It fucks your tankiness up.
You have to pray that your laner doesnt get ganked.

 Pros: Fast camps and good 1v1s in jungle lets him reach lvl6 Quickly. Full clear before 3:15 is possible, and his ability of 1vs1s allows him to be a quite strong early game jungler if not against Zhao or Lee sin, even though he scales very well. (Depending on the situation it is capable for you to win against Lee Sin, but not Xin Zhao, pre level 6. He just E Auto HoB QQQ-Ws and destroys you.) So focus on reaching 6 ASAP, and go find enemy junglers and bonk em.
As jungle morde goes tank items, he is very capable in teamfights and sustained fights. He can take an enemy into Death Realm if he gets focused too much, and he also has access to Zhonya. So jug morde is rather a teamfighter.

Conclusion: Morde jungle is better used as a counterpick against junglers like echo and lilia and so on, but it really is good for tricking enemies that ur a toplaner by banning stuff like fiora.<|endoftext|>I want to know where the average mord mains are

My macro after laning phase is pretty bad and I must say receiving an answer will help me a lot<|endoftext|>Does thornmail and morello anti healing affect stack?

So I had a fed Yas on the other team, and all I could think was healing Reduction

So I bought thornmail after rift (all ad enemqies) then I bought oblivion orb

It seemed to work since I could 1v1 even though he was way ahead but wasn't sure if it was just the lack of m.r. on his part<|endoftext|>And I can confirm that certain AD items are very worth taking. So I'll preface this with what is the purpose of riftmaker?

Riftmaker is meant to counter tanks specifically due to the true damage AND is meant to give a hefty omnivamp sustain.

But what if another anti-tank item not only did the job better but ruined any chance of another tank/bruiser from fighting you before 6 items?

I present to you, Dear subscribers of the Iron Revenant, the Divine Sunderer!

The concept is very simple. Sunderer does what Riftmaker does... only faster. Riftmaker takes like 10 seconds to fully stack and does a good job at beating tanks... but bruisers, divers, and assassins still remain problems.

With Riftmaker:

*-When behind it's not always possible to stack up riftmaker*

*-If your team fed the Diver you'll die before you can stack up riftmaker*

*-it's almost impossible to stack rift while fighting a poking assassin*

\-*fully stacking W is hard and takes 2-3 minion waves*

**With Sunderer:**

**-You can fight any bruiser when behind by Q-auto for trades and E them away**

**-The extra tankiness and magic Pen that sunderer provides will let you kill any fed diver pre-20 kills**

**-You don't need to stack this. One E-auto and you've won any trade with any assassin.**

**-Your W stacks MUCH faster on minions, so much so that it's 1-2 minion waves to fully stack.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

There are other benefits as well such as the magic Penetration on Sunderer scaling better with passive and, again, making W stack much faster.<|endoftext|>Between the kite, the flashes, the zhonias, the QSS and champs that duel you anyway ... It became very, very hard to make diff in TF if an ennemy is fed (typically mid / adc). I'm bored that the champ is so easily countered, NOT because the opponent play well, but just because of items.<|endoftext|>Hi, I like Morde but I want him to also succeed in high elo, so here's morde but with an overloaded kit.

**Stats**: Q isolated damage buffs reverted; base armor growth increased by 1; base health growth increased by 2

**Passive**: 3% bonus movement speed removed; steals 2% movement speed of all enemies hit for 5 seconds (duration is refreshed if they remain in the passive).

**Q**: Now has 2 casts; **Q1**: mordekaiser unleashes his dark magic in a cone in front of him, *grounding* and slowing all enemies hit (deals *low* damage; shape of this ability is similar to Riven's R2 but with less range); **Q2**: The same as current morde Q, but comes out slightly slower to offset Q1

**W**: recent W buffs to be reverted (sad); W2 (heal recast) removed; duration of shield increased to 10 seconds; While shield is active, become *immune to debuffs* (stuns, charms, roots, knockups, suppressions *will work*; grevious wounds, serpants fang, and being slowed *will not work*)

**E**: range and width decreased, cast time decreased (both by about 10%)

**R**: death realm is now centered around mordekaiser; cannot be interrupted by moving out of range or by loss of vision; stolen stats increased to 15%; if an enemy exits the death realm early (qss, gp citrus, olaf R), morde retains the stolen stats for the next 30 seconds

The stat changes simply feel necessary to become relevant. New pasivce gives him sticking power and benefits more from hitting multiple targets. With the changes to Q, morde now has a way to land a solid Q on enemies, however both casts can still be dodged, and the second cast comes out slowly, this combo mimics Sion's E into charged Q. New W changes decrease his shield power and lane sustain massively and shifts towards offering more utility, getting away with riftmaker's omnivamp, ignoring serpants fang effects, and slows, making it a high priority for enemies to break. New R changes dont make it entirely useless if they buy qss. 

Now, I understand that mordekaiser is a juggernaut, and by removing their respective weaknesses, you create an OP champion. *Yes*, that's exactly what I want to do. The new champs are completely busted, breaking every rule Riot has set for older champions, meanwhile morde will always sit in low elo, never getting a chance to appear in competitive play unlike our brothers at r/aatroxmains. I want our iron undead overlord to become more than just a low elo stat checker.<|endoftext|>not deal but not just fucking have a bullshit lane phase. I dont expect to kill her but it's pissing me off that even without dying, I can't do anything. Not even farm. Soon as lane starts she stands in that bush near my tower and only comes out to attack me. I run back after taking 3 hits, then she last hits her minions.

 my minions refuse to push to my tower, even though she's hitting hers. Any attempt at trying to fucking farm and she does her 3 hit bullshit. 

i was level 2 when she got level 6 because i couldn't fucking get near any of the waves.

so Like I dont understand what im suppose to do here? I cant fucking make my lane stop pushing somehow when she is attacking my minions doesn't make any damn sense.<|endoftext|>I’ve been thinking a lot lately of ways that Mordekaiser could be buffed in ways that weren’t just damage oriented (in light of his W buff.) one such idea I was thinking was decreasing the size of his ult as you put more levels into it. For example, lvl 1 could be the standard size where as lvl3 could leave it something like 20% smaller to force a fight more. Or the ability to convert stolen AD to AP. 
By no means do I claim to be a master of balance, I just want to hear some ideas fellow Morde players have thought of.<|endoftext|>When I played mord, I knew his kit was simple but I never thought he was brainless. Every where I go tho, people all say he is brainless. I feel like you have out play potential with ur e tho. So is mordekaiser as brainless as trydamere, malphite, or master yi? Thx for answering if you did :D<|endoftext|>Since it reduces the damage you take from your chosen nemesis, does it reduce true damage too?<|endoftext|>After he was reworked, I didn’t play him as much as I used to, I didn’t like him, he felt like a lazy rework where he was Darius 2.0 and blablabla. But recently, I’ve been playing him again, and I would like to go back in time and kick myself in the teeth :^) He’s surprisingly fun once you get over The old Lord, bonking with an Isolated Q, being a constant threat that scales well and being a complete pain in the ass because of your metal dominance is fun and satisfying. Issues I have is how easily countered and that what turns me off about him now.. but oh well. Anyways Morde is amazing~<|endoftext|>So I've been playing a lot of Morde top lately, and one of the biggest problems ive been running into occurs when I win my lane, but the enemy mid or jungle is so fed by midgame that I cannot deal with them even in my ult. This proved immensely frustrating until, on a whim, I picked up an anathamas chains one game. The dynamic immediately shifted, and the enemy yasuo that had been running away with the game now had to avoid me like the plague, and teamfights suddenly became even again as I locked them in a 1v1 with an enemy they couldnt kill for ten seconds at a time. 

Ruminating further, I believe that this item (potentially combined with either randuins or FoN) opens up a new lategame role for games where carrying as Morde is not an option: the Dedicated Anti-Hypercarry. Has anyone else had success/failure with such a mid/lategame approach?<|endoftext|>What is a good build for morde that doesn't use riftmaker ? I'm so tired of building that item every single game.<|endoftext|>So, Im a pretty new morde main; well, somewhat new to the game too. Hes almost the only champ I play, standing proudly with my 47k-ish points in him. 
Now, Ive recently started playing ranked, and shame or not, Im bronze III. However I havent won a single game, as I am constantly paired up with people like this 260k points, lvl 200 Volibear main, and yeah, he did me dirty, no matter what I tried to do.
Any tips to dealing with difficult enemies? Is it hard to make a comeback if I get behind in laning? Im up for literally anything.<|endoftext|>Like if you R someone and if you manage to kill them you get their ghost man I miss that drake as well.

Also imagine if you can put your W on allies as well like the dmg they give/recieve gets converted into the shield/heal. 

I just want a NECROMANCER man.... Rest in peace.<|endoftext|>

https://reddit.com/link/ot9joj/video/fngri0htcyd71/player<|endoftext|>In my time at league and this reddit I have been seeing a lot of people building and recommending thornmail. And, it could work in really specific situations, normally, is just a gold waste.

Why you build thornmail? It gives a decent amount of armor and health and has two passives. The reflected damage and of course, the anti-healing. But there is a problem.

Reflected damage with just one or two armor items is so low, because Morde doesn't have a good armor scale. That passive is just bad for champion. Health and armor? You have better items. (Anathemas or Randuin)

So, the anti-healing. A 40% for champions that attack you ON-HIT. And 60% for champions that you inmovilice, and I think only the E does this.

It only last 3s, and your E probably wouldn't grab all healing champions, still, is easy to dodge. Plus, take on account that a lots of passives, like runes or champions, heal more while on low health. Making a 40% or 60% a huge differential.

Then we have morello. 80 ap and 300 hp, good base stats. But the passive is the key, just deal magic damage, 40% if hp>50%, 60% if not. You need armor you say? Then just build a better armor item or anathemas, you will tank more or less the same.

To sum up:

Thornmail:
+Good stats vs a huge ad team
-Meh anti-healing
-Meh 1st passive
-That's it, no mobility, no damage, you can't proct the 60% really often.

Morello:
+Good stats in general.
+A great anti-healing, your passive procts the debuff to all champions in a tf, you just need to do damage.
+Works with champions that uses skills, not only for piu-piu or slash-slash bois.
-No armor or mr

Thanks for reading, thoughts?

PD: Still, building just the first anti-healing part vs ad is a good option, it gives a lot of advantages because you are using it everytime and, is cheap, so you don't lose a lot of gold for it.<|endoftext|>After vehemently being against Nashor's Tooth as an item, I decided to take the Nashor-Pill since the game was lost anyway, turns out I scaled alot better than I thought and we ended up winning the game.<|endoftext|>

Once you hit level 11 on champ takedown your abilities lose 20 percent cd immediately meaning for those close 2v1s in side lane you’d have w up just a little faster. For those giant team fights where your q is so close to coming up and w would of saved your life it’s now up. My question: do you think it’s worth replacing domination or resolve tree secondary?<|endoftext|>

I'm having a lot of trouble managing consistent performance in the top lane, however. There seem to be simply too many popular top champions (tk, irelia, and fiora as examples) who can bully Morde and deny him cs in lane, and playing him from behind feels terrible. Given how item dependant he is, I always end up feeling useless in the midgame if I lose lane. In the jungle, however, I have yet to encounter a "you auto-lose the early game" matchup, and consistently feel like I am impactful at every stage of the game. Am I correct in thinking that Jungle is a good role for consistency with Morde, or am I just bad at top?<|endoftext|>

If they don't qss on the animation before you even reach the death realm (even illaoi which SHOULD be an easy matchup for morde is nearly impossible with half decent QSS timings), stray CC, unstoppables, the rise of so many types of untargetability just mean that you'll never get your ult off.



His base kit blows. His W blows. His E used to be semi OK when it gave void staff pen at max rank but it too now just blows. Short of cranking up his numbers back to where they used to be to make his kit somewhat viable, he just sucks.

When you ULT someone you focus on your enemy, you dont scroll up to see the city scape or the black hole. 

The ULT effects should be in the middle rather than up on top. Like make the city surround the circle you fight on so you can actually see it.

Any thoughts?<|endoftext|>I wanted to make this post in order to give my thoughts on the state of Mordekaiser in high elo and what I think Riot could do in order to make him a lot better. As of right now,he is a bad champion that only works into melee team comps,where even there he can struggle due to the unreliability of his Q and E. I have compiled a list of PERSONAL changes I would place on Mordekaiser in order for him to be more viable and fun,as well as to diversify his playstyle and give him multiple build path choices. Before I begin listing them,not all the buffs have to be put on him,because then he might just be too strong. It's just a massive list of pottential buffs that COULD work well on him. Think of it as a mini rework like Wukong or Tahm Kench.

First off,some base stat changes:

Base movement speed: 335->340

Base armor: 37->38



**Darkness Rise(Passive):**

Basic attack AP ratio: 40%->30%

Magic damage: 5-15.2(based on level) per second->4-12.5(based on level) per second

On the nerfed passive it scales 0.5 every level,while on the other it scales 0.6 every level.

**Movement speed: 3%->Mordekaiser now gains 0.5/1/1.5/2%(1/6/11/16)movement speed per stack of Darkness Rise**

Due to the base movement speed buff,he will have the exact same speed when he passive is fully stacked. If that is too much,you don't need to buff the base one and just have it be a -5 speed until lvl 6.

**NEW: Mordekaiser converts 150% BONUS attack damage from items into ability power**

This change would open up a lot more diversity within his build.He could finally get something like Sterak's Gage and not feel like crap due to him wasting the attack damage. It would no longer feel like you need to use your ultimate strictly on a tank to gain any use out of the stat steal,because anyone else would give close to no useful stats to you. It sounds like a lot,but in actuallity,it isn't all that much. If you buy something like Goredrinker,which gives 45 attack damage,Mordekaiser gets 67.5 ability power. For comparison,Riftmaker gives him 80 ability power AND it's 100 gold cheaper.

Let's say you are level 9,with a completed Goredrinker. The face value is 67.5 ability power. Mordekaiser's base attack damage at that point is  87.96.The spite passive would add an extra 15% attack damage to it,which gets converted to ability power. That 15% translates to 19.791 ability power,so it would match up the riftmaker once he is lost 75% or more of his hp.



**Obliterate(Q)**

**Scaling per level damage removed**

Cooldown: 9/7.75/6.5/5.25/4->9/8/7/6/5

Magic damage: 75/95/115/135/155(+ 60% AP)->70/80/90/100/110(+50% AP)

Damage increase: 40/45/50/55/60%->20/25/30/35/40%

**Enemy champions hit will always take the increased damage.**

**NEW: While in Realm of Death,Obliterate's cast time is faster and the damage increase is doubled**

This means that at level 6,the damage increase goes from 30%(if you maxed q first) to 60% in Death Realm.



**Indestructible(W):**

Cooldown: 12/11/10/9/8->13/12/11/10/9

**ACTIVE: NEW: Mordekaiser now also gains percent damage reduction based on the percent value the shield has and gets slowed for that amount.**

**RECAST: NEW: Mordekaiser speed himself up for 2/2.25/2.5/2.75/3 seconds base on the percent value the shield has.**

This one is going to need a bit of explanation because I did not know how to write it in a more comprehencable manner. Let's say your w is full,meaning 30% maximum health. If you use W then,you will have 30% damage reduction,but will also slow yourself for 30%. This amount changes as the shield goes down,so the initial value does not matter,as it can go from 30% to 25 to 20 and so on. On the recast,you speed yourself up for the percent amount. If the shield is only 15%,when you recast it you will gain a 15% movement speed increase for the amount stated above. It is also worth nothing that runes like Revitalise or items like Spirit Visage will up the precent as well. For example,the shield is the full 30%,if you have Visage,it will amp it by 25%,meaning the shield amount will be 37.5% maximum hp. The damage reduction,self slow and speed are affected by this. The change is meant to be as a form of compromise: if you want to tank up hard in the middle of a teamfight,you will be quite slow. If you want to chase someone down,you will need to use your only sustain tool to gain that speed,making you much easier to kill should you use your ultimate on them afterwards.



**Death's Grasp(E):**

Magic damage: 80/95/110/125/140(+ 60% AP)->80/85/90/95/100(+30% AP)

Width: 200->250

Pull distance: 250->300

**NEW: While in Realm of Death,Death's Grasp's pull is faster**

I didn't have many ideas for his E,so I just thought buffing the utility side of things on it while nerfing the damage would be a good change,as it would make it a lot more reliable to hit and to pull them slightly closer to Mordekaiser.



**Realm of Death(R):**

**NEW: Mordekaiser will now also steal movement speed**

**NEW: Mordekaiser will gain full passive stacks**

Cooldown: 140/120/100->140/115/90

I think Mordekaiser not stealing movement speed is a change that is needed for him. I might be wrong on this,but I am pretty sure he is supposed to steal "core stats",and I am assumming the stat that helps your character to move is quite essential.

Well,these would be the changes I would implement for him. I think it would be interesting to see how he would perform after some changes like this,the W and passive AD conversion change especially so. Feel free to share your thoughts and ideas. I love having discussions on these kinds of topics. Sharing this would be much apreciated,to people like "kaizermordelol",who is a Mord main,or people who might enjoy this kind of discussion like "imls". I'm pretty sure none of these will actually get implemented,but it's worth a shot I guess.

Is he really that unusable in high elo?

Or do you guys in the higher Ranks have any positive experience with playing Morde at a higher level? 

Or maybe you know some high elo players who main Morde (I know of Kaizer Morde tho)<|endoftext|>I have no idea if it's viable but I'm curious if anyone has tested something like Night Harvester - > Zonya's Hourglass -> Cosmic Drive -> Banshee's Veil -> Visage. Hypothetically, late game all of QWE becomes pretty spammable and you naturally build AR/MR when you go this route.<|endoftext|>Versus 0 MR and 4000 HP target, it will add a maximum or 48 damage per second + 10 MR and 10 armor on you (for a maximum of 20 armor / MR if you touch the 5 champs). That's ... very bad for a melee champion and has to be used mostly has a harassing bonus tool for high range champions that will not deal constant damages to their target.

You clearly don't have the slot for it ; boots + Riftmaker is mandatory then you have 4 slots for :

\- Cosmic Driver 3 or 4 : EVERY build please, that's your best item mid-late from far.  
\- Nashor : especially vs squishies  
\- Zhonia : Very good in a lot of situations  
\- Rylai Crystal Scepter : good at third items vs champs that can escape / kite / that take early QSS  
\- Thorn / Morello : both situationals, but both goods  
\- Force of Nature / Spirit Visage / Abyssal Mask : vs heavy APs (FoN better vs DoT / kiters, SV for the heal, Abyssal for massive damages / buff team damages)

Some more uncommon : Void Staff, Rabadon, Randuin (full AD, 3+ crit champs), etc ...<|endoftext|>Since the ítem was released I've been using it especially when the other toplaner picks fiora/vayne/sett or the enemy team or 4 ap 1 ad / 1ap 4 ad, so far it has worked well for me but I really wanna  know  your opinions.

When u were not beating someone 1v1, simply because ur champ is crap, getting that shield back 2s earlier does nothing. You are not getting it twice in a 1v1. So we're left only looking at teamfight performance: You get it back a little bit earlier IF you succesfully:

1. Get someone into your R without you being completly destroyed first in some random CC
2. Get your passive activated first or fast enough inside of it
3. Your damage is SOMEHOW high enough, to actually kill someone (which requires to absolutley hit EVERY SINGLE Q and E, only 1 miss and the damage is too low)
4. Your opponent doesn't have a single CC and/or dash, because thats all it takes to mitigate 1 Q and survive 7s
5. You actually WIN that 1v1 (a lot of champs are just like "lol you R me, now i kill you kek")
6. Then, and only THEN you walk out of it with your 30% HP remaining if it was someone who fights back in your R and get to re-shield yourself 2s earlier and survive maybe 2s longer in the incoming burst of the enemy team, that is completly uncontested by yours and only waited for your R to run out

Oh! oh! And ofc! You get to heal 34HP 2s more frequently while laning x3 So you have GREAT sustain now, I guess?

I'm waiting for that 1 day, when they partially revert the movespeed nerf on his passive. Honestly, we dont need base stats, durability, damage, whatever. We need to get a little bit more consistency like back then. On release the Movespeed%+ on his passive scaled from 3% up to 9% with his Champ level. They completly removed that scaling and it stays on 3% since forever now. Just Bump it up a little bit and make it scale up to 5 or 6% with Champ level. Also that 1s less passive runtime (it used to be 5s active) hurts like sht up to this day. These 2 changes are literally the main reason why he is so clunky now. On rework release (when admittedly he was too strong) he felt smooth, because you actually got some noticeable speed and your passive didnt just turn off because you got slowed by 1 Soraka Q or something.

Also srsly, did anyone read the Blitzcrank buff-text? They said they give him a new coat of **METAL** (Base Amor 37 -> 40).

Meanwhile Morde:<|endoftext|>https://youtu.be/XSNqxi08h_4

When this feels so much better: riftmaker, cosmic, rylais, visage/banshee, nashors.

Now i play a lot of nasus and jax and always found it weird how morde is probably the single bruiser that sits on 15 ability haste for most of the game. Cosmic is such a great item that I don't think anyone should skip imo, it reduces all of your cooldowns by a lot it honestly makes morde feel like a different champ, and as a bonus you just get to move around much faster and clear faster. Rylais is also great, it might not fix all of morde's issues but it ensures that once you land your abilities there's no getting away. I wanna know if anybody else likes to build like this too.<|endoftext|>Lifesteal but epic

 probably wouldn't do well in ranked due to all the GW items and you'd probably get bursted down before you get to heal, but man is it fun.

Do you guys think a shield/healing build morde will work next patch? If so, what do you guys intend to build exactly?<|endoftext|>I feel like a lot of the Mordekaiser player base feels the champion is way too squishy late game in team fights, and while he is useful for picking certain targets if they have qss or are out of range he gets nuked almost immediately. I think it would be a cool feature if morde was effected less by stat decreasing things. For example as a passive for his ultimate lvl 16 mordekaiser is affected 40 percent less by effects that lower his stats. If an enemy has 35 percent armor pen this effect is reduced to 21 armor pen for morde. Obviously the numbers could be changed up for balance reasons, but I wanted to know how you guys felt about this change being a possibility.<|endoftext|>According to [https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Types\_of\_Crowd\_Control#Forced\_action](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Types_of_Crowd_Control#Forced_action), mordekaiser's realm of death is considered a suppression which falls under immobilization effects. If this is the case, why during his ultimate does the bonus damage not apply?<|endoftext|>To be specific i’m talking about how his vernacular is that of classic novels even though he is a tyrant and a brute in his first life.

Chances are tho yone or yasuo would get their ultimate skin before morde simply cuz that would sell better. But the point I’m making is that  I’ve seen game devs purposely buff characters simply to sell their skins better. So do you think they are holding off on that or nah? Don’t get me wrong I love the new buff to his passive but I don’t know if that would be enough.<|endoftext|>

I'm gonna be going around every (champ)mains sub and asking the same question, do you think ______ needs a rework? 

I'm asking if you think there is a fundamental flaw in their kit, not just "they're to weak now" or "they're to strong right now" purely through stats. If stats can change and they'd be balanced, then they'd be fine. 

Not asking if you want an old version of the champ back, (lookin at you aatrox mains) or if you think it should get a vgu, but if you think the champ deserves no rework, a mini rework kinda like mundo or a full rework like Aatrox. Thank you!

**Runes:** 

Precision - Conq, Triumph, Alacrity or Tenacity, Last Stand

Resolve - Conditioning, Revitalize

AD, AD, AR or MR

**Starting Items:** 

Blue smite, Refillable

1st back -> blasting wand, boots. 

**Core Build:** 

Frostfire Gauntlet, Demonic Embrace, Rylai's scepter (or Cosmic Drive. To get the 160 AP passive you need to buy 1 more AP item of your choice.)

Frostfire gauntlet to get that juicy mythic passive and make chunky jungle Kaiser as chunky as he can be. Demonic Embrace here synergizes pretty well with the Frostfire burn, and it gives you a buttload of health. Rylai's is similar, slows on ability damage so you can reach them easier and apply Frostfire, and gives you a lot of health. Cosmic Drive is a good alt to Rylai's,  it offers a lot of utility. 

**Tanky Items:** 

DMP / Thornmail (Zhonya's if you went Cosmic Drive and need armour, doesn't give you HP aside from mythic passive), Spirit Visage, Anathema's Chains. 

**Boots:** 

I go boots of swiftness or Ionian boots early (unless you really need counter boots). 

**Full Build:**

A good mix of MR / armour

* Frostfire, Swifties, Demonic Embrace, Rylai's, DMP / Thornmail, Spirit Visage. 

Straight MR 

* Frostfire, Merc treads, Demonic Embrace, Rylai's, Spirit Visage, Anathema's Chains

Straight AD

* ' ', Ninja Tabis, ' ', Cosmic Drive, DMP / Thornmail, Zhonyas<|endoftext|>So far, Mordekaiser is just too busy in his own realm, because the people who die in Noxus ends up in his realm, and he is dealing with them.


But if he ever decides to return, his return will not be very easy, but he has everything to deal with those things.


There is LeBlanc and the whole Black Rose with Vladimir and his own cult (they probably wouldn't do much, since they deal with blood magic, not necromantic sorcery). But knowing that LeBlanc probably fears him, I think it's very likely that he can overpower them.


Rell who is specifically have been trained to fight with Morde and is confirmed and she can beat him once because of her iron bending magic. But not more than once, because if Morde get's defeated, he can just come back knowing how Rell fights and with a new armor that she can't do anything with.


Entire Noxus, with Swain, Darius, Sion amd the others with a gigantic army. But Morde has his own army, and it will be just expanding as the Noxian soldiers die.


The sentinels are probably going to be in the way.


The other bad guys like the watchers, the darkins, ect. might be in the way too, but he need to get trough the good guys.


Kindred might need to get involved, because Mordekaiser genually said fuck you to death and refused to fade away, made himself permanent, and not letting other souls to fade away. And he is planning to expand the reaching of his Death Realm. That means if he is able to do that, not only the ones who die in Noxus but the ones in Ionia, Demacia, ect. will end up in his realm too. If that's not enough to get into Kindred's attention, I don't know what is. And as I know, we don't know if Mordekaiser is able to overpower Kindred too.<|endoftext|>I tried looking for the answer elsewhere but I couldn't find it anywhere, so I came here. My friend told me it didn't matter who you took to the death realm in terms of stats because it only steals base stats, not item stats too. In one of Glacierr's videos, however, he said to almost always ult the fed enemy because you benefit the most from stealing their stats. So, which one is correct?<|endoftext|>

I feel like that's a statue of Mordekaiser. If it is, it's kind of weird because LeBlanc tried everything to make Mordekaiser forgotten, it wouldn't be logical if a statue if him got out of her attention, but it maybe just a little easter egg about him.<|endoftext|>Hello everyone, it's me, Ácido Cítrico again.Inspired by the future **W** buffs and the Mathematically Correct Sett Build, I had the wondeful idea of using by mathematical skills to find best possible item and rune combination that grants the **biggest viable and strongest shield / heal** to our metal overlord Mordekaiser. In this case though, we are going to focus on the instant healing.Here are the details about his ability, according to the Wiki:

* Mordekaiser's **maximum shield** scales with his **30% maximum health**.
* Mordekaiser can recast this ability to heal himself of **50% of the remaning shield**.
* **Conclusion:** In normal conditions, Mordekaiser's **W** can only heal a maximum amount of **15% of his maximum health**.

How can we increase this value? By using healing, shielding and maximum health increasing items and runes. Firstly, lets see the items that are available to us that directly increase healing and shielding power:

* Staff of Flowing Water.
* Moonstone Renewer.
* Ardent Censer.
* Redemption.
* Mikael's Blessing.
* Spirit Visage.

Depending on how much you are willing to sacrifice, there will be more item slots available to you. Since Mordekaiser is a very immobile champion, I don't think that sacrificing boots would be the best idea, since it is possible to build **Lucidity Boots** for a nice CDR buff.Now I will explain which items you should take:

* **Spirit Visage:** you should always build it. It has the greatest healing and shielding buff of all items (+25%), and an above average maximum health bonus.
* **Mikael's Blessing:** has the second highest healing and shielding buff (+20%), and grants you a good utility active against CC that also heals you. It also provides a decent CDR buff.
* **Redemption:** also has the second hightest healing and shielding buff (+20%), while also granting a decent amount of health and CDR. The active is really powerful in team fights, and can also be used to heal you, while dealing **10% maximum health as true damage** to enemies in the area.
* **Ardent Censer:** provides a miserable amount of healing (+10%), but an above average amount of AP. The passive is useless unless you take **Font of Life** in the runes, and build **Rylai's Crystal Scepter.** Not recomended.
* **Moonstone Renewer:** provides a decent amount of health and AP, and a nice amount of CDR. The passive is really powerful if, and only if you are a **Support Mordekaiser**.
* **Staff of Flowing Water:** provides a miserable amount of healing (+10%), and an average amount of AP. The passive is only useful on mage allies, and only works great if you take **Font of Life** in the runes, and build **Rylai's Crystal Scepter.** Not Recomended.

Now that you know all of this, and assuming we want an independent Mordekaiser, then **Spirit Visage**, **Mikael's Blessing** and **Redemption** are the items you must build. With only these items, you have:

* A shield that can reach up to **54% of your maximum health**.
* An instant heal that can reach up to **48.6% of your maximum health.**

Nice. We still have two item slots left, so in these slots we can build the two items with the hightest maximum health bonuses in the game:  **Warmog's Armor** and **Anathema's Chains.** These two items alone provide 1450 bonus health and 30 AH, and not only that, but Anathema's can make you really hard to kill, you can use it when having trouble with a specific champion on the enemy team. Warmogs allows you to re-enter fights after a little rest.

Now, let's pause for a second to realize that this build has an abnormal amount of CDR, I mean, it provides a total of **90 AH without runes**, meaning about **47.36% Cooldown Reduction**. At maximum rank, your **W** should be up every **4.73 seconds,** your **Q**, every **1.89 seconds,** your **E**, also every **4.73 seconds** and your **R,** every **47.36 seconds**. Really OP if you think about it.

Ok, now lets take a look at the best runes for this setup:

* **Grasp of The Undying:** most effective against tanks, not so much against bruisers or ranged top laners.
* **Shield Bash:** combos perfectly with Mordekaiser in every aspect, increasing effectiveness of your shields, while also providing a decent damage bonus, dealing about **4.59% of your maximum HP** as magic damage, not considering the base damage of **30** and the **1.5% bonus health scaling.** With **Revitilize**, this becomes **5.049% of your maximum HP.**
* **Second Wind:** really good on extended fights and combos with your healing buffs.
* **Revitilize:** increases shielding and healing power by **5% when healthy, 10% when below 40% HP.** With this rune, you will have:
   * A shield that can reach up to **59.4% of your maximum health**.
   * An instant heal that can reach up to **58.806% of your maximum health.**

As for the secondary runes, you can take **Last Stand**, and **Legend: Alacrity**, to increase your dueling power. Do not forget to take **Attack Speed, Damage and Armor/Magic Resist** on the extra little stat runes.

And that's it. I did not test this yet, so i do not know how powerful this can be, although is it essentially another version of a Tank Morde. Something that everyone also should know too is that, even with a **60% healing debuff**, you will still heal about **23.52% of your maximum health,** and when Mordekaiser gets buffed I will recalculate these results, which should increase considerably.<|endoftext|>Brothers and sister let us pray to our death god...

5. Cosmic Drive/Rylai's Crystal Scepter/Demonic Embrace/Morellonomicon
6. Cosmic Drive/Rylai's Crystal Scepter/Demonic Embrace/Morellonomicon

I sometimes would like to get a Spirit Visage, Thornmail, Randuin's Omen, or Deadman's Plate, but I don't like sacrificing my AP. Do you still recommend getting tank items?<|endoftext|>Hi Morde mains, I saw the buffs he got and excited because, well the champ I play is getting buffed. It made me question though, did he NEED a buff? A lot of friends I talk to say Mordekaiser is "broken" or "op" or that he has no counter. A lot of this if not all of this is anecdotal, but I wanted to see what everyone's experience has been. His highest win rate is in Iron at a 50.69%,  overall % is 49.32% with Diamond having his lowest win rate at a 47.13 (I don't count Masters - Challengers as he has below 1000 games played in each rank, but if counted, challenger would be the lowest at a 39.05% with 105 matches), all these numbers come from U.gg if you want to look at it yourself! I want to hear from every elo and how they see Morde, if he needed this buff, if he was fine before or if he's just a bad champion. They nerfed movement last patch which, for me atleast, made Morde feel more powerful and with this coming out he's gonna feel really strong. Do you think Morde's pick rate will increase, maybe ban rates increase? The numbers say he needed this but, but based on what I've seen people tend to dominate with him, at the same time people don't really tend to show themselves doing bad so maybe he does need it. Thoughts?<|endoftext|>That's it, riot is a joke<|endoftext|>I know a Rioter was posting about here a few months back but it seems to be MIA<|endoftext|>Why don't we vote for our main, aka the adc slapper<|endoftext|>tryn, fiora, irelia, and somtimes jax.


Trynd I just ban but they almost always pick one of those other 3. Against irelia and fiora I rush bramble and tabi, or whatever it's called now, and it doesn't even feel like it doesn't anything. 

at least with jax if I can get him to blow his jump it isn't that bad but still<|endoftext|>I'm curious if any mordekaiser mains have tried building this item, as it synergizes with his ultimate really well. Even if you're behind and in teamfights you have to ult the enemy carry so your team has a chance of winning the teamfight, you've got more armor and magic resist so you can survive longer.
The item passive goes away after a few seconds of being near teammates, but if you ult, you're alone and the passive turns back on, and when you leave the ult you also have a few seconds more with bonus resistances. Is this item worth building despite it giving AD and morde having no AD scaling?

My Rune page was: Electrocute, Cheap shot, Eyeball Collection, Ultimate Hunter. Secondary : Tenacity and Last stand with 2 adaptive force and armor.


The team against us was bad as a whole, we won every lane, but in jg, Jax was against me. In early, both of us wanted to gank bot. I almost died, I got saved by my laners. After I got Riftmaker, I just had a 1 item power spike, and after rylai's as second item, cheap shot did it's thing. I destroyed them.


I wanted to try it out at top, but against matchups like Sett, I'm not really sure of it's such a good idea.


But overall, I think it fitted well with both Riftmaker and my passive. If not to top, I can recommend it to jg, because whenyou gank, you can do a lot of damage. Or when you fight for objectives, some extra sudden damage can always come in hand.<|endoftext|>AHHHHHHHHH WHY RIOT<|endoftext|>like how do i as a melee champion am I supposed to win this matchup?

This mini-rework was created by me back in 2019, when AP builds were naturally burst-oriented and the idea of AP Fighter items were barely a thing. Although not much of a Mordekaiser player, playing against him was very common. Now, the great Item Rework has brought us Riftmaker, which seems to fit this champion very well. You also have Demonic Embrace, Rylai's, Cosmic Drive. Two problems arise from this, however:  


* AP itemization lacks the adaptability of AD Fighter items. Build paths are weak and they offer little versus the damage and mobility that creeps the game. In the cases they are worth it, it's more about the champions using them. As a Juggernaut, being ''unable'' to build Sterak's Gage is terrible. While AD mythics gained a lot of cool tricks, Riftmaker is simply ''more damage''.
* Less burst means Mordekaiser has to stay longer in fights, but his one-sided gameplay means that he wins when he wins and loses when he loses (strange wording, but I believe mains will get it). In other words, Mordekaiser gains very little for staying longer in fights unless he would win anyway. The reduction in upfront damage also makes the Ultimate's duration worth less.

As for the one-sided gameplay. After gaining Darkness Rise, it's all a matter of ''is the damage enough?''. In some situations, hitting Q is a must so to not lack in damage while, in others, Q is not even necessary when you kill them with autos. W is the same: a second Health bar when strong, not enough when behind. The Ultimate is simply terrible as it is, stat-checking taken to the maximum level, 7 seconds of pure do-or-die. Although, it the enemy has QSS, it's Mordekaiser who feels terrible.

Basically, Mordekaiser's gameplay is dealing damage in order to survive. When condition is not favourable, he's trash at both. The champion is clunky and the lack of identity is also clear. Darius equals infinite damage, Garen is a tanky executor, Trundle is anti-tank, Illaoi rules an area, you get it. Mordekaiser has no unique traits outside the Death Realm and now the champion has disappeared. But things can change if he were to regain his shield thematic. So this is the 2021 version.

**Darkness Rise:** Adjusted.

**--Additional damage on basic attacks**: changed from **40% AP** to **5-45** (based on level)**(+ 15% AD)(+ 25% AP)**.

**--Effect removed:** no longer grants additional **Movement Speed**.

**--Damage per second:** changed to **15-75** (based on level)**(+ 25% AP)**, increased by **1%** for every **1%** of **Health** enemies have missing.

**--New effect:** now stacks on large minions.

*Auto damage less dependent on being ahead. AoE damage made to be less dominant overall but more decisive at finishing low Health enemies. Stacks on large minions for better wave clearing.*

**Obliterate:** Changed.

**--Damage:** changed from **75/95/115/135/155** (**+ 5-139** based on level)**(+ 60% AP)** to **35/65/95/125/155 (+ 75% AD)(+ 60% AP)**.

**--Effect removed:** isolated enemies no longer take **40/45/50/55/60%** increased damage.

**--New effect:** isolated enemies take **6/8/10%** of their **Maximum Health** as additional **Magic Damage** at levels **1/7/13**.

**--CD:** changed from **9/7.75/6.5/5.25/4** to **7.5/6.5/5.5/4.5/3.5** seconds.

*Less explosive against squishy enemies, increased effectiveness against healthier enemies. Also less AP dependent.*

**Indestructible**: Reworked.

**--Damage dealt conversion:** reduced from **35** to **25%**.

**--Damage taken conversion:** increased from **15** to **20%**.

**--Shield pool:** maximum value lowered from **30** to **25%** of **Maximum Health**.

**--Shield decay:** is now linear at **7.5%** of **base Health** per second.

**--Shield max duration:** increased from **4** to **5** seconds.

**--New effect:** for the next **5** seconds after activation all convertion directly becomes a shield.

**--Healing:** changed from **40/42.5/45/47.5/50** to **40/45/50/55/60%** of current shield and ends the active convertion.

**--CD:** changed from **14/13/12/11/10** to **15** seconds at all levels and starts on cast (may be too strong, not sure).

*Reworked into something similar to his old Iron Man Passive. More juggernauty, less of a shield burst. 'New' identity as the infinite shield.*

**Death's Grasp**: Nerfed.

**--Damage:** reduced from from **80/95/110/125/140 (+ 60% AP)** to **60/75/90/105/120 (+ 30% AP)**.

*Simple adjustment for the rest of the changes.*

**Realm of Death**: Changed.

**--Effect removed:** Mordekaiser no longer steals **10%** of target's stats upon entering the Death Realm.

**--Effect changed:** now steals **Movement Speed** instead of **size**.

**--New effect:** Mordekaiser steals **2.5%** of target's stats per second for the next **7** seconds, up to **15%** (regardless of being in the Dealth Realm, but interrupted by the target's death).

**--New effect:** stat stealing is immediately maximized if target dies within the Death Realm.

\-**-New effect:** Mordekaiser keeps stolen stats for **8** seconds after the stealing ends (even if the target does not die), but they are also returned to the enemy.

**--CD:** now begins after exiting the Death Realm.

*Duels are less decided at the moment of cast. Rewards for picking harder fights and surviving. Mitigating ''guess I'll die'' situations after exiting the Death Realm. Removing cases where the ability is completely nullified.*

To conform to these changes, I also suggest increasing Mordekaiser's **Movement Speed** and his **Attack Speed growth** slightly, but reducing his **base Health** over levels.<|endoftext|>Title. Someone kind enough to give the community a fresh history of our metal boi?<|endoftext|>[https://u.gg/lol/champions/mordekaiser/build](https://u.gg/lol/champions/mordekaiser/build)

We seriously need to talk about ways of changing our champion that isnt a giant rework but still solving his issues, In my opinion Mordekaiser should get 1 extra armor per level from 37+3 to 37+4 and his movement speed should be increased to 340 from 335. I feel like this is the best way for him to not be shit, i dont even think bringing back the movement speed on the passive would make him good. i think giving him more base movement speed and more armor per level is the way.

If instead riot is dead set on buffing his damage then he either should get his attack speed changed from 0.625 + 1% per level to 0.625 + 3% per level or his damage on his passive needs to be changed from 5-15 + 1-5% max health damage to 10-20 + 1-6% max health damage.

Explaination

His attack speed is always been awful, with this buff it would help him scale better and to split push better, one of his biggest weaknesses is that Mordekaiser is one of the slowest champion in the game at taking turrets, wich makes him a essentially ignorable sidelane presence, this would help alliviate that that.

His passive used to be 15-40 + 1-6.1% max health damage, this was on release, when he was broken, but it was a very different enviroment back then, Mordekaiser used to have better base stats,  25% magic pen on his E,  5-10% movement speed on his passive and also Rylandy, now he lacks all of that, i think his passive damage can comaback, not quite as strong as his original self but we can go halfway there, i think this passive damage buff would help him beacause in this insane mobility enviroment a uncoditional source of damage would help him keep up.

Sylas steals morde Ult and ults Mundo which forces me to detach. Mordekaiser then instantly ults me and here we are 4 People in the same shadow realm! Now is that normal or was this a bug? So far i thought each ult would create its own shadow realm, so i was really confused.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ocr467)<|endoftext|>I don't post much on reddit, but I had this idea for a really long time. Mordekaiser's Theme is one of the most powerful theme and it really fits our iron revenant. My concept is very similar to that of [Swain's theme playing during his ult from a youtube video I've seen a while back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mQAEy05yeU).

It would be really cool if Mordekaiser's theme would be like a game mechanic that would indicate when the ult is gonna end much easier.

For example:

Morde ults someone, both players don't hear the music but others around the battle in the death realm can hear the music but very muffled, building up to the point when Morde kills or leaves the realm without killing someone. If Morde dies in his ult or doesn't kill anyone in his ult the music stops instantly.

When he does kill someone in his ult however, beginning of his Theme will play for everyone and the music will continue as long as he kills people and keeps going forward to kill more people. When he dies after killing someone in his ult and killing another person the music will fade out to the more calmer parts of his theme and finally disappear. 

Another thing music related I would want to see with Morde is how Pyke's Penta has his theme playing. I think with Morde it would work pretty well.

Let me know your opinions and maybe try to add something new, I'm sorry if I posted it in a wrong way, I don't use reddit often.<|endoftext|>SLOWER. it's just me or the autos and death grasp are slower? dude i'm losing some ridiculous cs since playing with that skin and not just that... my E feels like a turtle.

I feel like laning is with Morde is much more relaxed and less "tryhard" than with Sett. Few questions though:

1. What do you normally build on him?
2. On who do you normally use your ult?
3. Do you side push a lot with him or stick to team for TF?

But I only recently decided I want to really try to study to become a semi pro player.  I want to start with my main squeeze in the game: Mordekaiser.  I constructed this build with the help of a website:

Boots: Plated Steelcaps (Mercury's Treads against AP heavy)

Mythic: Riftmaker (Liandry's Anguish has been reccommended by other websites but without the mana surge being helpful it's virtually useless)

Sell Doran's Shield

3rd item: Nashor's Tooth (Zhonya's may be better but it's a personal flaw in my battle strategy that Zhonya's really just delays the inevitable

4th item: Demonic Embrace against both comp types

6th item: Morellonomicon against AD and Spirit Visage against AP

However, I know second opinions always help.  Any thoughts?<|endoftext|>Like do burns don’t activate conqueror? And Garen gets free conquer after hitting an E, so I think morde should have it too. Especially for his sustain early game<|endoftext|>Let me start by saying that I believe this build and role is perfectly legitimate as I have hard carried many times before.

Runes -

First Tree - Precision

Conqueror: Triumph, Alacrity/Tenacity, Coup De Grace

Second Tree - Domination

Cheap Shot, Ultimate Hunter

AS/Haste, Adaptive Force, AR/MR



Build:

1. Hextech Rocketbelt
2. Nashor's Tooth/Lichbane
3. Lichbane/Nashor's Tooth
4. Banshee's Veil (optional)
5. Rabadon's Deathcap

Boots - Sorcerer's Shoes

(Start Hailblade)



Explanation -

Sometimes you have to hard carry the whole team and 1 v 9, this build can do just that. It scales hard with the magic pen from Hextech and E passive and you won't really need to a void staff (if anything let your team take care of the tanks).

Runes -

Conqueror runes are pretty standard, helps with sustain to make you a tanky burst champion. Second tree is domination because E counts as an immobilization, so cheap shot for the extra true damage and Ultimate Hunter because 1 v 1. Since you're the jungler you want to be able to take anyone out at any time and your ult helps you do just that. You can go relentless hunter, but I like my ult better and ravenous hunter isn't really necessary as most of your fights will end in a few seconds.

Build -

Hextech is always first as it provides that movement speed you need to get a quick ult or whatever you want to do. It can also help with escapes and outplays. You should have t1 boots at this point.

I go Nashor's Tooth second because it makes the camp clears so much faster allowing you to roam and gank a lot more. It also provides on hit magic damage and at full build, you should be doing around 400 magic damage on hit every hit. You might be able to squeeze in boots here, I sometimes go full boots 4th.

Lichbane synergizes very well with Nashor's and basically makes your auto attacks a second isolated Q. At this point, you should be able to pretty much one shot.

Banshee's Veil is the least needed item, but still an important one. Having that spell shield is a mind game making the enemy champion choose which ability to waste on you. It might also save you from some major cc. It provides MR making you a little more tanky too. If you were to replace this, I'd suggest Cosmic Drive or even Horizon Focus since you have an immobilization which should make it proc off your E.

Rabadon's Deathcap is self-explanatory.

Jungle + tips-

TL;DR - cs hard, get objectives, fight after you spike a few times, nobody can beat you in a 1 v 1 if you get on them

I'm not going to tell you how to jungle, but helping your team before level 6 is dangerous, especially if you're playing into a cc heavy lane or just something scary. Mordekaiser can 1 v 1 the drake at lvl 6 no items (have your upgraded smite). I did it against the cloud drake so it might work for the others. Always trade objectives if you can't get both the dragon and the herald. Get both herald's, establishing lane dominance is very important since you can steal their camps and you have your kill their jungler button if you need it. If your in trouble when trying to secure an objective, obviously just ult their jungler early to make the smite battle easier, unless you can beat them without it. You can easily get penta kills (with a good team). If you're behind and your team is inting, just cs and get your items, you can get the free shutdown gold and spike even harder to carry.

I got tired of top lane ngl. You can check my profile for a penta.<|endoftext|>Hi guys. I would like to hear some opinions on the following item build:

So, what are the runes? Essentially sustain and anti-poke runes:

* Conqueror. --> Provides great sustain and damage.
* Triumph. --> The only actually useful rune in this rune slot.
* Legend: Alacrity. --> Mordekaiser's auto attack is very strong, use it to your advantage.
* Last Stand. --> The more dead you are, the more damage you do.
* Second Wind. --> Combined with Doran's Shield, Gangplank's Q poke won't do significant damage early on.
* Revitilize. --> Increases your W's Shield and Healing by 5%. Pretty useful because if affects everything, even regeneration from Second Wind and Conqueror healing.
* On the lesser runes you may get Attack Speed, Damage and Armor.

**# Matchup:**

First of all, Gangplank can't win a Level 1 fight against Mordekaiser in a direct confront. Mordekaiser's isolated Q damage plus Passive deals more damage with Conqueror on the long run than what Gangplank can heal with Grasp, Time Warp Tonic and Corrupting potion. This combined with second wind and Doran's Shield makes you quite powerful in extended fights, even early on.

* Something that you can try is to do is wait for Gangplank to appear in the tribush, and them cheese him to force a Flash or to use a Charge of Corrupting Potion, which will sometimes force his TP back to lane, anyway, this screws him a lot.
* In lane, you must predict when Gangplank will go for a Q on you. You must Q him everytime he Qs you in other to trade damage. Your Q deals way more damage than his Q when he is isolated, and deals about the same damage if Gangplank's Q critically strikes, which is rare, so on average you win. Just don't forget that your Q has a longer cooldown. You can also block some of this Qs with your W. This damage is significanly reduced if you buy Tabis. Gangplank Q becomes stupid once he gets sheen so I think this is a high priority item.
* Once Gangplank gets his barrels, you must, no matter the cost, focus them first, specially level 13. It is his main source of damage that garantees him safety, damage and mobility. If you destroy his barrels he won't be able to play the game. That's the reason you get attack speed on the runes: to be faster than him. If you are still having a hard time, buy a dagger. If you are not able to reach his barrels, or the barrel is with 1 health, bait a double barrel combo so that he uses his barrel charges, and if that does not work, try waking in and out of the range of the barrel so that he autos it trying to predict you.
* Once Gangplank gets his Orange, you must bait him so that he uses it when he is about to die. Only then you can ult and kill him. You can rush Morello to make the healing almost useless. This can be done if he is stupid and blindly goes for a Q when you have E. He can dodge your E by running away with his passive, so pay attention to his sword model and barrel explosions. He can also Q Spam, Hit and Run tatics to take you down.
* Your ult counters his ult if he is without Orange. Do not stay in the ultimate, it will deal more than 1000 magic damage to you with the "Fire at Will" upgrade and 300 bonus true damage with the "Death's Daughter" upgrade.

**# Details:**

* Putting levels in your E won't do anything, so focus your W after your Q.
* You get a Good Power Spike against him after finishing Morello + Tabis, and a huge one after finishing Riftmaker, but his Trinity Force can somewhat handle it if he plays well, essentially you would be almost equally matched, he still has the Orange advantage, although you also still receive the Buffs for 7 seconds.
* Building attack speed will force Gangplank to play perfectly if you are ahead. Use this to your advantage, becuase he must hit at the very least two barrels and two passives to kill you.- Gangplank becomes very powerfull at level 13. You should only fight him after finishing 3 items at this point, specially if it is a good Gangplank with Trinity Force.
* Building Spirit Visage is a really good idea since this will make your W Shield pretty much stupid, and Gangplank will need Chempunk + Serpents Fang to counter it, otherwise he is dead. The extra healing also combos with the runes and items.
* In the late game the matchup is on Mordekaiser's favor because of Mordekaiser's passive. Gangplank must kill Mordekaiser in about 15 seconds or he will die, as Gangplank usually does not build MR. For instance, a Gangplank with 53 Magic Resistance will die sonely due to your passive in 15 seconds, assuming you have 285 AP, which is not hard to get. You can make his life even more difficult by buying Demonic Embrance, Rylais and the new Anathemas Chains. By the way, you become immortal with Anathemas Chains, so use it.

That's it, hope everyone here gets better at the game. I will post the Math later for you to see, it's pretty interesting.<|endoftext|>With a ton of movement speeds items bring nerfed, it honestly feels like a buff to Morde. The new item Hullbreaker was also introduced to allow split pushing which gives you AD and Armor and Magic Resist when alone and additional damage to towers. I was wondering if people have tried the item on Morde, I personally tend to split push pretty often, probably more then I should of especially when I'm fed. Since a lot of the items give Morde a ton of HP as well I was thinking that maybe this item wouldn't be too bad on him, my only issue is that it gives AD. Thoughts on this item on Morde?

Like, I personally hate when I leave my lane, and my percet stat even after a counter play like Fiora, get's ruined in teamfights because the support was someone autofilled and had no idea what to do or something else.


I can't farm, because the others will die without their juggernaut, but having items is important on Morde, since we are not Garen, who uses his Q and E, and when  see that the enemy is low enough, just press R and he dies, all this with no item.<|endoftext|>Heyo, like every other game the music for Mordes Dance (Ctrl 3) is either nonexistent or very very quiet, I had my volume turned up to full blast and couldn't hear it at all.<|endoftext|>I'm not very good at league, currently in mid to late I'm focusing on joining teamfights to ult the strongest player or the champion that would cause the greatest threat to my ADC or team (e.g 10/2 Zed/Yi or malphite with ult).

Viego is the one who controlls the Black Mist and he is the source of it (as I know), and he is going to be the star of this new event, but if we look at the things from the lore, Viego is not the only one who has anything to do with Mordekaiser being able to come back. It's LeBlanc, and she is more important than Viego imo.


We know that LeBlanc after she betrayed Mordekaiser, she tried to make sure he wont come back, but destroying his armor wouldn't be enough, she had to lock the source of his power away, wich is the Well of Death. But LeBlanc never locked it away completely, people still can go there, and Mordekaiser's empty armor is still there. But she made sure that people will completely forget that he even existed. Mordekaiser knew about it, but didn't do anything about it tho.


Now there is 2 thing, one is in his story, and one is in the game.


One is that In the realm of the dead, Mordekaiser has a bastion that is similar, or maybe completely the same as the Immortal Bastion, and in the over world Morde already sorted out the strongest souls, when he destroyed the throne that the souls made, and in the heart of that bastion, there is the "gate" he can get trough, and the Well of Death must be the "gate's" other side, and Mordekaiser is ready to go over any time, and he must be planning to expand his army.


The other thing is that when Mordekaiser first encounters a Shadow Isle champ, he says "The same magic that chains you to this realm frees me to walk between". This just tells us that, Mordekaiser is beyond the Shadow Isles, the mist is nothing to him, and if he wanted to use the mist and the Isles magic to come back, it would be useless for him, because how far he is from his Bastion, and he already made his realm fit for him.


But this might mean that Mordekaiser might be able to do something with the Mist, because we know how strong he is. The magic of the Well of Death and the magic of Viego's black mist might be similar, or even the same, because Mordekaiser knows about it.


So here is my conclusion:


Mordekaiser is beyond Viego and his magic, but if the mist reaches Noxus, and it falls, Morde might be able to do something to come back, and he WANTS to come back and he has already prepared his army. But the thing is, that LeBlanc might have a word or two about that. She was able to get rid of Mordekaiser, and lock him away from the world of the living, so she knows what she is doing. And after what we have seen in the ruination animation, that must have been alerting for everyone at the Bastion.<|endoftext|>Hey tinheads,

Been seeing a lot of posts recently about AD scalings. Just curious what you guys think would be an appropriate way to implement them if they ever were?

My idea is to put a bit of AD scaling on the Q (alongside AP) but leave the pure ap scaling on the E. Would be simple and also make a bit of lore sense since the mace is "physical" and the E is a "magic hand" making him still a mostly AP champ.

Share your ideas below!<|endoftext|> So... Morde ult can be resisted with crowd control immunity and removed with cleanse effects BUT the duration is unaffected by tenacity? (Tested new item Anathema's Chains).
 A little bit sad ngl.<|endoftext|>Perhaps this will get me a lot of hate from all you Mordekaiser fanboys out there (eventhough I'm a Mordekaiser main as well)

Patch after patch I always find the usual post complaining about Morde's state and asking for more buffs, when he got buffed twice already.

Let me be clear, Mordekaiser is never going to be a good champion out of low divisions unless you're fighting inmobile compos. That's it. No matter that you keep asking Riot to give him 1k magic damage on his Q with no items, he's still going to have the same issues: His damage completely relies on landing VERY dodgeable skillshots.

All the buffs you keeps asking for won't fix anything, because his kit is just bad and useless on higher divisions.

Buffing his damage EVEN MORE will make him a frustrating champ to face against if you're a melee, because he literally rapes you, but, at the same time, he will still be super kiteable, counterable by QSS, etc.

This is what I think. Hopefully, not many haters will come to tell me "B-but Mordekaiser's WR on Master+ is (random number) 40%. He is bad at high elo, that's it. The reason other noobchamps like Garen work at higher elos a bit better is because Garen can't possibly miss his skills. I could keep going all day, but this is pretty much it.

Have a nice day =)<|endoftext|>I can't resist the urge to post, sowy.<|endoftext|>I know it's too early into the patch to make any reasonable conclusions, but Mordekaiser is struggling really hard right now. Not that it wasn't expected.  Can Riot please buff/tweak Demonc Embrace and Rylai's already so that they become better ap bruiser items?<|endoftext|>Let me preface this by saying that I don't think that anything you're about to read is meta. You won't deal more damage, you won't snowball harder, and I doubt you'll win more games.

But you will get ***dummy thicc shields and heals***. That's my one promise.

TL;DR Moonstone renerwer + spirit visage doesn't cripple you as much as you'd expect, and results in hilariously large w shields and heals, making you unreasonably tanky into AP comps. Continue reading for math and such.



Mord's W heal is interesting because it is (to my knowledge) the only heal in the game that 'double dips' into heal and shield amplification effects. Since the heal scales off the shield size, it first gets increased by the shield part of 'heal and shield amps', then further increased by the healing part.

So what does the math look like? At max rank, a fully charged W will normally heal Mord for 15% of his max HP  (30% Max HP shield x 50% conversion) With a fully charged moonstone renewer (which now gives a whooping 35% heal/shield amp), this becomes \~27.3% max HP = (30% x 1.35) x (.5 x 1.35). That's an **82.25% increase in the W heal**.

Now here's where it gets silly. Not only does Mord's w heal benefit quadratically from heal and shield amps, this amp stacks multiplicatively with both spirit visage's amp \*and\* the low-HP amp from the revitalize rune, which both also stack quadratically with themselves. With the aforementioned 2 items and rune all active, Mord's  fully-charged W heals 55.5% of his max HP: (30% x 1.4 x 1.25 x 1.1) x (.5 \* 1.4 \* 1.25 \*1.1). That's a **270% increase in the heal**. Note that revitalize also gives 5% heal/shield amp, thus the 1.4 in this equation instead of 1.35.

I generally build damage beyond these two items, but it gets reaches a funny breakpoint if you add Redemption or Mikeal's Blessing (both 20% amp) into the mix. With either of these as your third item and low hp, **Mord's W heal will be greater than the shield**. This is especially nice because W doesn't go on CD until the shield is gone. So if you immediately heal instead of sitting on the shield, you effectively gain 3.5 seconds off your w cd, so you're that much closer to more big numbers.



As far as actual runes and builds, I've only played this in normal games a handful of times, and only once since the most recent patch, but I think the best runes are standard Conq primary runes, plus revitalize and shield bash (which did more damage than coup de gras in my last game).

For items, I go d-ring or d-seal into renewer first. The second and third items are Spirit Visage and Cosmic, although the order depends on the enemy comp: SV first it it's 3+ AP, and Cosmic plus an extra codex first otherwise (the codex is needed to hit 160 AP without d-seal or conq stacks). My 4th item is usually zhonya's to ensure that you get a second shield in most fights, and to round out your resistances, although in 4/5-AP comps you might be able to skip it in favor of redemption or a real item. I go cdr boots if I can get away with them, otherwise whatever defensive boots are needed.



Other considerations:

\- Although moonstone gives worse stats than other mythics, it's much cheaper at 2500 gold, so it's better to compare moonstone plus 700 gold to riftmaker or other AP bruiser mythics.

\- The healing from conq is interesting in that it is *not* reduced when dealing AOE damage like normal omnivamp, and it gets increased by all of the aforementioned sources of heal amps. This means that with conq fully stacked, every 11% heal/shield amp is effectively 1% better-for-AOE omnivamp. With the 2-item-1-rune combo at the center of this build, Conq's 9% healing becomes 17.3% at low hp.

\- I'm not sure if other people have this problem, but I personally struggle against bruisers and skirmishers who build BoRK with normal Mord builds. This build lets you avoid the worst of BoRK's % current-HP damage by sitting at low HP with an enormous shield. I've beaten (admittedly behind) late game Jaxes this way.

\- moonstone's ally heal is on a 2 second cooldown, but it only actually procs when you deal damage or affect an ally in champion combat. For most champions that probably means that they're proccing it every 3-5 seconds at best, unless they somehow have the focus to track that 2-second CD. However, Mord's passive in a teamfight guarantees that this is going off as much as possible.

\- naturally because of spirit visage being a core part of this build, this works best into AP heavy teams, but the sheer girth of the shield makes it shockingly viable into even damage comps as well.

\- The fact that everyone and their mother builds grievous wounds every game is one big con against this build. But then again Mord is normally screwed by GW when building riftmaker and double vamp runes, so it's not really any different from usual.

That's all my rodent brain has for you guys. If you're still reading, I hope you found this entertaining, and consider trying it out (although maybe not in games with LP on the line :P).

Good luck, and remember: ***IRON STANDS ETERNAL***



edit: formatting x2, math correction - thanks to Negran for pointing it out.<|endoftext|>RIght right, I know what you're thinking: 'An AD item on a champ with 0 AD scaling? Preposterous!'

You might be right as I've not done any mathematical testing on the thing, but it seems somewhat viable to me if you're looking to split forever to inhibs while your yuumi-soraka egirl duo are running it down bot.

The Passive makes morde an even stronger splitter than he already is, and the AD isn't entirely a dead stat especially if you build nashors for AS, as well as smacking those towers for more damage.

The dealbreaker for me though is that the item is also good in teamfights for the metal man, as our ult instantly gives us the full armour and MR, making it easier to stall out hard fed carries when zhonyas isn't up and making winning fights more healthy.

Again, I might be grasping at straws here, but the item does seem quite nice, especially for some more tankier builds.<|endoftext|>Hello Mord Mains.



I have been playing practically only Mordekaiser now in ranked for almost 60 games now.  I have been finding that I use very similar items each game with the only thing that really changes is the order I buy them.  I will change out Thornmail for Merello's for GW if we don't need/already have a tank but overall I rarely find my self drifting too far from the recommended items.



A typical build for me is:  

Riftmaker-> Nashor's-->HourGlass -> Thornmail/Demonic Embrace -> situational item

with Boots, bramble and other components build when needed and the order I get them depending on the match up. 



Is there any time where Riftmaker isn't the best mythic item on Mord?  I found myself watching Hashinshin's stream and I asked if there is ever a time/matchup when playing more where it isn't the best option and he replied "only when you're f##king trolling".  Although I always enjoy a streamer replying I am wondering if there is anyone would go rocket belt against high mobility teams or if Sunfire is ever an option for a tanky mord.



In the past I have not enjoyed ranked very much but I have dropped my champ pool to Mord and if he is picked/banned I'll go Darius.  I currently am just under gold with a \~61% win rate on Mord.  one tricking in ranked (especially someone somewhat easy to play) makes learning other aspects of the game for easier and much more enjoyable so I'll plan to keep playing the big guy.



Kinda ranted a bit but any build paths to try out (or telling me Hashinshin is right) would be would appreciated.<|endoftext|>The best thing about old Morde was the fact that we had Ad/Ap Scaling, there's a couple items (streraks/goredrinker) that id love to experiment with, but our ability damage gets so cut down it's not worth the wonderful item effects<|endoftext|>E - Death's grasp

Passive: Mordekaiser gains 5-15% Magic Penetration.  
Active: Mordekaiser summons a claw in the target direction that grants sight of the area, dealing 20-70 (+30% AP) magic damage and, after 0.5 seconds, deals it's damage again, pulling enemies 250 units.

R - Realm of Death

Passive: Mordekaiser's damaging abilities Mark enemies for 0.5 seconds.  
Active: Mordekaiser slows all Marked enemies for 75% during the cast time, after which they're banished together with Mordekaiser to the Death Realm for 7 seconds. Additionally, for the same duration, Mordekaiser consumes all targets' souls, stealing 10% of their core stats. If any targets die while inside, Mordekaiser keeps their partial stats until they respawn.<|endoftext|>I don't play ranked, and I have heard that Mordekaiser is only good in low elo.

Is there anyone who is in high elo and a Mordekaiser main, and if yes, how is it?<|endoftext|>But hexblade doesn't exist anymore, and I guess having the only serious option being riftmaker is very "customizable"... -___-

Just looking for some advice, thanks in advance.<|endoftext|>I know it's AD(fk riot always giving ad best items) but it give armor and mr and boost cs. Do you think it will be a good thing to buy it ?<|endoftext|>Morde's laning feels terrible to me. 

You can't freeze lane and harass at the same time because of the nature of all of your abilities being AOE so it's hard to win against Kayle and Nasus and you're really immobile so a lot of characters just run away from you and ganks feel like you're guaranteed to have to blow a flash. How do you get around these issues?<|endoftext|>What do you guys think, will Riot do anything between Morde and Viego? 
I really doubt Mordekaiser would just sit this event out, but then again, Riot doesn't like to do much in terms of lore with Mordekaiser.<|endoftext|>Just imagine how cool it would be.


The passive looking like a Blood well, or being bloody. Thick armor, showing some of the dark and red flesh, maybe some glowing behind the armor, like Aatrox's chest. Glowing red eyes from the helmet, the E's hand that pulls them closer being a demonic hand, when the W activated blood comming out from the armor where we can see the flesh, and I would absolutely love that in the ult, it would be like being at the bottom of the well where they seald the darkin away.


And I love the idea from the Project skin, that when in the ult, and after killing the other, getting a now look. It would be cool of he would look corrupted, like the legs and arms of Varus. Or being classic, blood going around him, having a red and bloody crown above his head, between the horns, seeing the darkin's true face.<|endoftext|>Hi I’m a bronze supp main looking for a top duo. My top laner has fed in solo q 13 games in a row so this seems to be the only solution lol (yes I counted). Only requirements are to be in bronze or silver and to have a win rate above 45%. I play Xerath and can guarantee 50+ vision, a fuck ton of damage, and a makeshift ADC replacement if ours sucks. I can also main ADC if you prefer that. Msg me for summoner name if interested.<|endoftext|>Idk if this is a bug or not but if it is, it just singlehandedly lost me my ranked game.

When I tried to ult J4, he also uses his ult, my ult connects while he was in his leap animation, and J4 successfully used his ult to trap my team while my ult went on cooldown. 

I think there's something similar to this that has to do with the fog of war, but at least that doesn't put my ult on cooldown. That bug alone just lost me my ranked game.<|endoftext|>i saw a morde montage video.Gave it a try and boom. 25/4. Holy fuck is this?

So what do I like about him?

1. He's intimidating visually/character wise. His character alone makes me feel like a badass.
2. He is intimidating gameplay wise to the enemies because of his ult.
3. He is somewhat tanky due to his shield but also does good damage.<|endoftext|>seriously guys , why do you think u r so chad and all , where you main the most virgin coward gameplay in league ? 

i was a 9/1 volibear jng and yuumi attached to me and had over 3k gold advantage over him , guess what would the 1/2 morde top do ? yep as no one expected , he Rs me and statchecks me to death (outplayed me of course) literally missed 2 Qs but it couldnt matter less . 

a champ's entire kit based on ulting someone and autoattacking him to death no matter the gold gap doesnt make u a chad , it just makes you not able to think as everyone else and use ur kit in multiple ways , your entire purpose in the entire game is to R someone and statchecking him to death with no counterplay whatsoever , wich makes youlesser than all the other players and just a coward who cant really outplay other players so you just main this unoutplayable statcheck abomination .<|endoftext|>Now don't get me wrong, I like him as much as the next guy, but every time you try to talk about some other threat someone goes "Lol Mordekaiser could beat them" etc etc.

Elaborate please!<|endoftext|>Hello Mordes, 

I am REALLY struggling with this game and need to improve.  I have a 58% ish win rate, but aren't really moving up.   Math would think over time I would, but I dunno, guess not.

I don't know when to split push and when to group.  85%-90% of the time I am going to WTF destroy my laner, like I am 2-3 levels + up on my laner, with like a 50 CS lead, and the first tower is gone.  The only time this isn't going to happen is if I play against a much higher level smurf, or I get camped like its a family vacation.  At this point, I don't care if it's a "counter" Mordekaiser pick or not, doesn't matter.  

From there, it goes to **complete crap.**  

I would think logically, I should take rift and try for second tower, because I KNOW the other team will have to send at least 3 people to deal with me.  But every single time, and I truly mean 100% of time when I've attempted this (past 70 ish games, it must be me), the other 4 players on my team won't get a dragon, tower, push a lane, or anything really useful.  They'll be like farming our wolves, or chickens, like standing around near a tower defending it from literally no one.  It's just the low elo.  It's now a fact in my mind.  So I need a Plan B.  Because splitting just results in me giving up shutdown gold to the other team. 

Okay, so then I think, let me group, since we can't understand numbers, split pushing, and how to use that as an advantage,  fine, we all learn differently, myself very much included.  So I group and ult their most fed person, and kill them. Then BOOM, I come out of ult, my team is either dead, or gone, and I'm then stuck trying to deal with 2-4 people.  

It's like a massive coinflip.   You got people like "What's a ward do?" and you got others farming 8-9/CS per min.  One game I did more damage than my other team (4 other players with like a Lux support) combined, while being first in the game for damage taken, and first for towers destroyed, and STILL lost. Now I know I have a lot to improve in this game, as I am not perfect, I am not Faker or some crap.  Nor do I think I am.  But I know for a damn fact I am better than the laners I am playing against 9/10 times without even question. 



So I am doing this wrong, and I need to improve.  Because if a really good player had the kind of lead I have, I believe they would be able to carry the game, whereas I seem to fail. 

Any videos or detailed websites ya'll can recommend?  It shouldn't be this hard to get the heck out of low elo.  I made high diamond in SC2 with far less difficulty.<|endoftext|>I started playing Morde post rework, and I had a lot of fun at first, but it did grow a little old just doing the same thing over and over again, and when I saw how Old Morde was, I thought that looked like a lot of fun. So it got me thinking, what if they did a partial revert?

Give him his old W (toned back a little since the heal amount was sometimes a little ridiculous), and put his old ult ghost as the bonus for killing the enemy in the Realm of Death? Tie the ghost to the respawn timer like the current one, but maybe have it scale with respawn while having a flat number, like 5/7/10 seconds (depending on ult level) + respawn timer. Get rid of the stat steal since that might be too overloaded, and also it's not like he benefitted from certain stats like AD anyway. They could also have the enemy slowly take damage from the realm, so they can't just run away or hide in a corner and get out completely unscathed. Not a lot of damage, but just some of his AP (5% or something). Maybe it applies burn effects from demonic and Liandries like the old ult, but probably not. Maybe they could also put his old passive as part of his new passive, giving him a shield that builds over time while enemies stand inside of it. I personally can't think of a way to mix the Qs, maybe put the isolation damage on isolation, or if you hit 3 in a row on champions? And the E seems fine as it is now for a gap closer. Maybe some of his AD ratios could be brought back for more build variety?

I think this would work to give him back some of his skill expression, while still maintaining the idea that, to quote that one Riot employee, "There is no escape from Mordekaiser". On top of that, it wouldn't alienate either group, the Old Morde or the New Morde crowd, since he would have aspects of both in a champ that doesn't only press 2 buttons for his full combo and then stand there and auto you the rest of the time, maybe pressing W if he needs a shield, and pressing R if more people show up

Does this seem like too much? The main parts that I would want to see are just a W revert and the ghost back on the R, the rest are just some random ideas to maybe bring back some more of his old identity and give him some more tools to play with. The goal wasn't to make him OP or overloaded, just to give him some of his old kit back to make him more fun to play<|endoftext|>I think we can all agree that Cosmic Drive is an ideal item for Morde...it has literally everything he wants.  AP, HP, movement speed, CDR.  It's getting +5 AP and losing -10 MS.

&nbsp;

I assume we're still going to be building this, though?<|endoftext|>Basically title, no matter what post I click it brings me to that one post. Its been like this for a few days.

My question is

 what the fuck?<|endoftext|>I get that it gives him armor and AP, but is the active actually good?  You don't have any dashes or outplay buttons, so when your 2.5 seconds are up, you just die anyway.  And I feel that Morde with Zhonyas usually ends up far less tanky than without, unless it's against an all AD team comp or something.<|endoftext|>sup<|endoftext|>Hi. So sometimes in lane, I do well and get quite fed. Then I use this advantage to gank other lanes which may go well. But say for example, it's late game, and the enemy is fed and I'm also fed, what do I do? If my team isn't ahead then I feel so weak because the enemy destroys us in team fight very easily. I even target the most fed with my ult but if my team is dead, then I'm dead. I feel like I could improve but I feel so clunky late game :(<|endoftext|>

https://reddit.com/link/o181co/video/fthumdczfn571/player<|endoftext|>Let me explain my self first xd

One thing i will not reject is the fact that Morde losses the match up against fiora, statistically she is a counter to Morde

Being said that, i don't think fiora has a kit that counters Morde..
When i think in a morde counter comes to my mind Rengar, even gangplank, champions who are able to do things against our abilities, make them useless or have a gameplay that doesn't let Morde play how he wants, for example Gnat, who can poke all day long, all in when he has mega and even if you ult him he will force you to afk in the death reason sure to it's chain cc and slow.

Now Fiora instead is a champion you actually can fight, your abilities are useful against her, even your e can help you bait her parry so you can ult her later and fight in advantage with the statistics you steal. She's a melee champion with no excessive mobility (Akali) meaning you will be able to make good use of your passive.

So why so many Mordes lose to her? (Including me a many games) Fiora has just more damage and very high DPS short trades, in a long fight she procs her ult and becomes immortal with that insane healing. So fighting her i don't feel countered, i just feel how her damage exceeds mine, once she gets life steal she can abuse her short trades and all in whenever she wants. Can i call a counter champion if it only deals more damage and stands longer in the fight? Like, trynda would be counter of everything cause he has insane damage and builds even more damage since he will just press r and start fighting with his immortality.

From my perspective fiora isn't a counter, of course will win the trades but not countering your kit but dealing more damage, the only real countering tool she has is her q to dodge, the parry isn't a counter tool I fact cause as i sad you can just bait it with e and walk away before it pulls.<|endoftext|>Hello Community!

Morde and Sion play out pretty differently but they fulfill similar fantasies (big slow guy with a big slow weapon).  It helps that Morde and Sion Q have quite similar range.

Basically, I'm just learning matchups, learning how to play different lane states, and I have a few questions for experienced high level Morde players if you're willing to help.

&nbsp;

a. When do you take Alacrity vs. Tenacity?  How much should lane matchup play into it?  I.e., they have a decent amount of CC on their team, but their top laner has no CC and it's a volatile matchup where the extra attack speed might help?

&nbsp;

b. When do you take Doran's Shield and when do you take Doran's Ring?  I tend to take Doran's Shield most of the time, and especially against poke champs, but I've recently started taking Doran's Ring against champions I think might try to all-in or fight me early.

&nbsp;

c. Teleport is standard and is what I've been taking in all cases except against Darius (Ignite), but are there certain matchups you take Ignite, Ghost, or (I've heard it's good) Exhaust in?

&nbsp;

d. I've been taking Fleet Footwork against ranged top laners.  In my experience, it helps a lot with surviving certain lanes like Teemo, GP, Karma, and Heimerdinger.  Is this a pretty good option or should I be trying to tough it out with Conqueror for later teamfights?

&nbsp;

e. You've poked your laner with a few Qs and they're at 75%.  Their jungler, who is a level down on you, ganks.  Do you R the laner or the jungler?  Or do you base it on who is less mobile?

&nbsp;

f. Who should I be trying to R in teamfights?  I've had a good time Ring junglers at dragon or baron fights, or if I land an E on a squishy, but is there any sort of general rule?

&nbsp;

g.  Any unorthodox rune choices that you like?

&nbsp;

h. What is your preferred way to clear the wave?  (I've seen E-Q-auto but you run the risk of losing CS sometimes, I've also seen E the melees backwards into the ranged minions and then Q everything.)

&nbsp;

i. Do you ever build different mythics than Riftmaker?

&nbsp;

j.  Any good streamers who discuss their plays and talk about what they're doing that I should be following?

&nbsp;

Thank you in advance!<|endoftext|>Hey,im a main mord obviously and i got 100 k points on him. I win my lane/draw every game but when im against darius or kled i lose in champ select (perma ban fiora and nobody plays jax top or vayne in silver). Please give tips on how to draw lane. My last game i was 11/8/4 against a fed darius (30 minute game or so) and normally i dont die more than 6 times in a 40 minute match. I need help from the mordekaiser gods around here :)<|endoftext|>Hello, I'm not a morde main (Obviously), but an enchanter player who's having some issues against morde. (Kinda thought it would be best to go to the morde players)



What am I meant to do if I get morde ulted, or well... how can I maximize my chances or survival? I feel like even if morde is 0/5 he'll still find a way to kill me in his ult... 

Item's like mikeals doesn't cleanse it so I'm really not too sure what to do... are there any enchanters that can generally survive him? Are there things I should be doing to survive?<|endoftext|>

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/nys4lp)<|endoftext|>So recently I played some games against sett and I lost most of them could u tell me any tips on him it's very unfunn to play against him<|endoftext|>Just got to play this for the first time and I have a few thoughts.  It seems Mundo-favored, but I think Morde still wins all-ins.  With Doran's, Second Wind, your W, and constant dancing, you can sort of sustain through his barrage of poke, but E runs the risk of straight up healing him depending on the location of his barrel.

&nbsp;

It's one of those weird lanes where neither one of you can actually kill the other: he has superior poke and sustain, you have superior all-in but no way to really all-in him unless you get him quite low THEN hit two consecutive E's.  But his constant poke threat makes it quite difficult to CS properly.  Nor can you ever run him down or press an advantage due to his Q.

&nbsp;

Might be one of those matchups where jungle is the deciding factor.  Thoughts?<|endoftext|>Yesterday, i played against Gwen. She's so weak in early game but in late game she's really powerful. What do you guys think about Gwen?


By the way i won the game.<|endoftext|>i cant ban both, so how do  I with these matchups? even with bramble fiora does 1000 true dmg to me and slows my attack speed to hell. riven full comboes and uses her 5 dashes to escape before can even do anything. how know what to do?<|endoftext|>If you take Olaf ult, use it BEFORE you cast Death Realm on somebody. His ult actually cleanses your R for you, which is really weird cause QSS doesn't do that. Try to use Olaf R first and then use Morde R.

(also Ahri ult is op on him)<|endoftext|>What u guys prefer bramble then steelcaps riftmaker or steelcaps bramble riftmaker or bramble riftmaker boots?<|endoftext|>I always take Riftmaker because with the true damage passive I can ult people and get rid of them fast, even if they are tanks, but I have seen people take rocket belt, because of the mobility it gives, or people take Night Harvester because it gives some mobility and extra damage too.


Are there certain matchups or team comps that makes you decide what to take, or it's the playstyle/preference that makes you decide what to take? In my case, it's just the true damage. Gotta love being an iron juggernaut.<|endoftext|>Yes I am aware I can mute and I do. Just had two matches in a row. First match was against Irelia, beat her in lane and she went like "Takes a lot of skills to play Morde, op champ, then next match I had Kled who I beat and he went like"nice job playing a broken champion"

Just wanted to know if anyone else also had the same experience?<|endoftext|>I've got me a question

Added an FAQ about Mordekaiser

Mundo will be added later this patch

The full guide may not make it (Morde doesnt need one)

Thanks<|endoftext|>Looking to test Mordekaiser and Mundo interaction with mordes r. It's "supposed" to block it according to riot. HMU if you can help.<|endoftext|>can morde kill illaoi if illaoi has Qss?<|endoftext|>When I leave top, I usually have good kda stats, but when it comes to team fights, without my ult, I just can't do anything, but bonk them when I have a chance, and my stats are slowly getting worse.


I usually take their strongest and most fed champ out of the fights, so the others can deal with the weakers, while I try to 1v1 that 1 guy, with hopes that I will be able to win in time and get that 10% of his stats, but other than that, really nothing.


If I get them with my E, I might get ourselves into unnecessary troubles, and I can't really do anything to protect, or save my team. And I can't solo carry, because Mordekaiser is genually not that strong in teamfights. I can fuck my W, it has a lot of cooldown time, even with ability haste, and even when the bar is full, I only get enough shield to get enough sustain, that would save me when others are at low hp too, and they are just 1 Q for me.<|endoftext|>I was looking forward to playing on my phone but I installed it today and found out they don't even have Mordekaiser as an option, does anyone know when/if he'll be added? Also do skins still work that I own on characters? Cause I logged in with my riot account<|endoftext|>Hi im the guy from the post that asked the most efficient build on mords. That post helped me so much thx guys. But my question now is:is lich bane good with him? I tried it once because mords basic AD is high and the item scales with AP i think. It does so much damage ! I did it once for trting and then stopped but should i continue buying it? Or its just not a good item for him? Im m7 100 000 points mord for the record. :)<|endoftext|>Second full item? (Boots dont count)

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/nws825)<|endoftext|>TLDR: only read the portion between -----    ------

So I have been periodically posting changes I can think about here.The core idea of those changes is increasing the kits deptht ( equal power, less of a statcheck champ )

\-------------------------------------------------------

\--- Stat steal on ulti 10% >>> 0%  
\--- Isolated Q bonus damage >>> heavily nerfed or removed  
\+++ new passive effect:Hitting Q or entering the Death Realm causes **ongoing** passive to gradually **\[increase its damage by 50% and size by 25%\]** for **\[4 seconds, stacks up to 3 times\]**  
Killing a player inside the Death realm adds **\[another stack\]** into passive and prevents passive and its stacks from lapsing until the enemy resurrects.

\--------------------------------------------------------

So the way you'd play it out is holding ( when possible ) the Q until you have your passive procced, then try to hit as many Qs as possible to extend passive range and damage, eventually ( possibly ) reaching the backline.Killing a player in the death realm is now considerably harder, which is also more fair for the enemy. At the same time you would be on a quest to kill the enemy inside.If you manage to do that, on top of the basic advantage of having one less target to deal with, you will no longer have to worry about keeping your passive up.Ultimately, should you be able to fully stack the passive, you'll be holding into 200% more damage and 100% bigger size to reach even the backline and melting everyone around you. NO ESCAPE.

Tell me what you think<|endoftext|>Currently Gold 1 half way towards Plat 4 so i may be wrong on some things. I post this in chat in champ select during every single ranked game.

And any other tips that might be useful.<|endoftext|>Hey metalheads

Have played a ton of nexus blitz matches this season and I love playing morde here. Anyone also feel like this in nexus blitz? You touch anything and you proc the passive (dummy, jungle monsters...). Teamfights where your passive engulfs everyone. And its so nice that you get your 1-2 items very quickly where you actually feel useful.<|endoftext|>

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/nw9z8w)<|endoftext|>hey fellow mord mains i have 100k points on mord and every time i pick him i demolish the enemy top laner and he started claiming that mord is a braindead champ like garen adn sett any thoughts on this and personaly i think that he is not since every time he gets picked i counter him with aatrox which is pretty much a skill matchup and i win<|endoftext|>I see more and more people hate on Mordekaiser. People call him noskill, braindead, broken, a not normal toplaner, ect, but I don't know why.


Yes, he is strong, and sometimes I feel like he needs some balance, but I absolutely get mad, when a lv 6 Gwen player with her true damage giving, machine gun speed Q, and her shitty mist that says"fuck your attacks" says that Morde is not normal but Gwen is.


There are many champs that are more broken than Morde. And Mordekaiser is only strong after items. And people think that he is a maily tank champ, because of his shield  that his W gives him like what Garen have. And I know that he can be a tank too, but still, tanks builds are not the only good ones for him.


I once saw a comment about Mordekaiser that said "hes a tank with a broken ultimate and he also does damage (tank btw)". It's not completely wrong, because of you go with a tank build or items that give hp too, you can still do damage with your passive and Q, but sometimes I feel like that people just have no idea what to do against Mordekaiser and how he works.


And if people really hate Mordekaiser's ult so much, there is literally an item that can take them out and a champ that has a ability that does the same. I have only saw someone take Quicksilver ONCE, and it was today when a Sett used it.<|endoftext|>Using stats from 11.11 he holds a 48% wr in Diamond+ EUW wich was pretty much the same as when he got buffed last time, so he Is likely to get a buff sooner or later.

I'm a new Morde player so I am confused.<|endoftext|>Hello ever since the new morde rework came out I hated it. I had a plan where I used to hit 2 of my Q's on a minion and use my 3rd one and ult by flashing on a adc + some items here and there.As of now I really hate being kited as this champion and even 1 q hit is not enough to punch trough shieldbow vayne. She deals damage faster to me than I do to her. The only way for me to even have a chance is if I hit everything (even E which is impossible because of her dash) + proto and lich bane second.I would like to know some suggestions how to deal with kiting and simply being out damaged by an adc in a 1v1.

Edit:

I stopped playing the champion because I simply didn't have an answer to everything with him. When I see a vayne I just don't want to play this champion at all.<|endoftext|>Hear me out on this one.

Morde jungle is actually viable

https://preview.redd.it/x31kbfszw7471.png?width=1282&format=png&auto=webp&s=408e463786a5cccdd3488cef2241ac9a2f2e8628<|endoftext|>I just wanted to put out my own thoughts on reworking current Mordekaiser. I have seen plenty of people say about how Current Morde is bad or the rework sucks while others say it is good. So I decided to make my own take of how the rework should be to try and make it feel like Old Morde while also feel like Current Morde. I already put some thoughts on another post for reworking current Morde.

  
Link to that post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/kh0xt0/my\_idea\_for\_a\_mordekaiser\_revertrework/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/kh0xt0/my_idea_for_a_mordekaiser_revertrework/)



Passive: Attacking an enemy champion or monster with an ability or Auto Attack gives Mordekaiser 5% Movement Speed, 1/4/7/10% omnivamp  and 2 - 5% tenacity. His Auto Attacks deal 40% AP bonus magic damage on-hit.

Q: Mordekaiser slams his mace down, dealing 70 - 155 + 50% AP (plus 30% AD) to his targets. If the target is isolated, his Q deals extra 50% AP damage while his AD remains the same. 

Cooldown: 9/7.5/6.25/5/4

W: Mordekaiser stores up 35% damage he deals and 15% damage he takes as potential shield for 30% of his max HP. When W is casted, he consumes all of the potential shield to shield himself and gains an AOE around him that deals 10-20 (level) while scaling 50% AP and flat 5% of target's max HP. The shield will last for 5 seconds before it starts to decay. When Mordekaiser recast W, he consumes 20% of the shield for health and deal a small burst AOE damage. If Mordekaiser dies before his W duration ends, he still will deal a small AOE burst damage.

Cooldown: 14/12/10/9/8

Duration: 10 seconds

E: Mordekaiser sends out a claw that drags his enemies closer to him. This deals 80-140 + 60% AP and also slows the targets 10% - 50% for 3 seconds. He also has passive magic pen.

Cooldown: 22/19/16/13/10

R: Oh boy, the big one. Mordekaiser targets an enemy champion and sends them to the Death Realm for a One on One duel, stealing 10% of their core stats and instantly activating his W with max shielding but slowing him for 0.5 seconds. If Mordekaiser kills his target in the death realm, he permanently gains 2% of their stolen stats, maxing out at 10%. This ability will still go into cooldown if the target has displacement immune or CC immune. However, it will not go into cooldown if the target happens to be a clone or Sion's passive. If the target has the ability to remove CC entirely, the Ult will not go into cooldown until the duration has ended and Mordekaiser's W will still be active. However, Mordekaiser loses the 10% stat steal but gains 2% of the stat steal back if he successfully kills his target before the duration ends.

Cooldown: 140/120/100 seconds

Duration: 7/8.5/10 seconds.

The main changes I have made are to his passive, W and R. These are just my ideas for what his rework should have been while also still retaining some of Old Morde's traits. Your thoughts?<|endoftext|>I bought the project pass because I didn’t have enough for project morde skin but enough for the pass. I was wondering what are the chances I can get project morde?<|endoftext|>Or is this a case for Vandiril...

I wasn't sure the first time, but I just had it happen again. Morde ults, I use QSS, Morde simply ults again.<|endoftext|>I've found myself into around Plat 2 elo and I came to the conclusion that hardly ever do I have any pressure against enemy champions like Sylas, Sett, Volibear, Gwen... And the list goes on, those are the champs that first came to my mind. Am I doing something wrong? I tend to try and position myself so I can land some isolated Qs which I do from time to time but it's so hard to stay close to people long enough to deal some decent damage and even if that happens their burst overpowers Morde hard. 

I know there's some players out there that have made it all the way to high diamond on Mordekaiser so are there any tips you guys could share with me? Playing safe is not really an option sometimes due to how many plays can the enemy top laner make compared to me with the lead and pressure they get off during laning. 

And kind of the same problem happens late game, Morde's damage is unreliable since his Q is the main source and it's dodgeable. Passive is really not fast enough (even though it shines a bit more compared to early game). I'm tempted to play a bit safer early game for a full pen build instead of sustained riftmaker. What do you think?<|endoftext|>Hi guys, im new to morde. Used to spam aatrox, but i really like morde\`s kit.

Im trying to reach diamond on stream, if you like to give me tips.

I was reviewing my Mordekaiser states and I am not sure how to convert the data into wins.  I think, I need to learn how to carry this game.  

My states are MILES ahead of the league I am in.  I think that's good.   Like CS per min, mine is 5.8, and the average silver is 5.0.  My damage per death is 5,744, and the average plat is 3,783. 



I have A combat, A income, and A- Map Control,  so I guess that's good for a report card, but I still don't get wins, only 58%.  Most recently, I was 22-5-10, I did 20k more damage than the next person.  I took the most towers in the game, still lost. 

I guess, it just feels like it doesn't matter what I do in some of these game.  I don't have the ability to literally 1v5 these games...

Is it me, Mordekaiser? Both?<|endoftext|>Should i Max W or E second on Tank Mordekaiser?<|endoftext|>Electrocute Mordekaiser is pog. Proc ur passive u always want to. Extra damage said goal provides you. Also burst damage is poggerino so its poggers.<|endoftext|>Hello,
I see often people doing different builds like they go lots of damage items after riftmaier like demonic, nashor cosmic etc. But then sometimes I see people going demonic then a tank item like this mail or randuins. How do you decide? I know this mail is good with healing but I look at people's opggs sometimes and it often seems kinda random.

When I see memes like Chad tank build enjoyer or average ap builder etc and get confused what is actually better in which situation.

Also I see people a lot saying when they're behind they go tanky but I don't get this, then you are just tanky but do no damage almost.<|endoftext|>

Items ar pretty much what you want.


Primary runes: Dark Harvest, Taste of Blood, Eyeball Collection, Ravenous Hunter.


Secondary runes: Bone Plating or Second Wind and Revitalize, but you can go with something else if you want


I have no idea why this came into my mind, probably because I didn't got enough sleep, but I shared it with others so I don't make a complete idiot out of myself in game, and I don't want to be reported.<|endoftext|>Whenever I play this matchup, I try to free farm and get ganked to hell. I have formulated a new build to counter this. Instead of building Riftmaker, build Sunfire instead. Then, you will survive ganks and scale. Riftmaker makes you too squishy early game, and you need to build it to deal with jungle pressure.<|endoftext|>I bought project Mordekaiser at full price worth it? Maybe. Did I give money to a free to play game for a skin? yes yes I did.<|endoftext|>Passive-None  
Morde doesn't really need one he's cool enough without a passive

Q-Flash Mastery  
As we all know flashing mastery is one of the most easy way to show that your champion is high skill and you are a good play so this ability will mostly be a placebo to make you confident in yourself.

W-Type Jg diff in all chat  
This is a situational ability for most players as you won't lose any games due to your high skill and perfect macro and micro but sometimes even you can't save your game so this is when this ability comes into play you can let everyone know just why you lost lane and who really lost us that game.

E-Get solo killed Tp back and get solo killed again  
This ability will likely be what most players chose to take at level 1 due to the amount of ease you will have in most game due to challenger just being too low of a rank for morde mains. This ability will be the first of it's kind in league as it will actively make the game harder for you if you use it will help keep you on your toes and make the game less boring.

R-ff 15  
This ability doesn't reach it's full potential until 15 minutes into the game but can be used earlier but at a lower power level, if used before 15 minutes it will send a message in chat saying "Team to heavy gg ff15" and if used after 15 minutes will start a surrender vote every 5 minutes until the game ends, this will allow you to gauge your teams mental and end games quicker giving you an edge in the time your games take.<|endoftext|>My Mordekaiser Rework

W - Indestructible

Cooldown : 16/14/12/10/8

Passive : Mordekaiser stores 30% of the post-mitigation damage he deals and 20% of the pre-mitigation damage he takes \[reduced by 75% on minions\] as a potential shield on his secondary resource bar, up to 35% of his maximum health. The Potential Shield decays by 8 − 25 (based on level) every second after not dealing or taking damage for 1 second, down to a minimum of 5% of his maximum health.



Active : Mordekaiser consumes all his current Potential Shield to shield himself for 4 seconds for the same amount. The shield initially decays very slowly but exponentially increases near the end. While this shield persist Mordekaiser gains 10/20/30/40/50 Armor and Magic Resist. Indestructible can be recast after 0.5 seconds while the shield is active.

Why ? I think that Mordekaiser is currently split into 2 conflicting identities, his entire base kit asks you to get in the middle of the frey and dish out massive AoE damage while his Ultimate forces him to duel. With this rework i want to solidify him as an AoE threat, wich i also feel serves his gameplay fantasy of the invincible warlord that can take down an army by himself better. His ultimate is HEAVILY inspired by Volibear's ultimate, wich i think is ok given that we have had arleady very similar ultimates in the past (Nasus, Renekton). Volibear's has a higher damage ratio while carrying the turret disabling utility, while Mordekaiser's is a more selfish ability.

With this rework i also hoped to expunge the heavy frustration caused by his current ultimate wich makes him near impossible to ever fight and also feels terrible when an enemy buys QSS for the Mordekaiser player.

Numbers are, of course, subject to change, all criticism and questions are welcome.<|endoftext|>

Does anyone know if Morde's passive will proc the slow from Rylai's?  What about the DoTfrom Demonic Embrace?  



Noob question I know, but I don't think I saw the little frost or whatever that is, when I had Rylai on; I did see it from my E and Q though.. thought I'd ask to confirm.



Thanks.<|endoftext|>Hi, i am getting into top lane recently, mostly playing Gangplank and Camille, and have found decent succes in most games, unless i go against a mordekaiser, i somehow feel like i can do nothing at all against him. Do you have any tips how to play against him, champion specific or in general?  


For example, i played 2 matches recently, as Gangplank and i went 6/19/12, of which around 12 of my deaths were to mordekaiser, or when i played sett i went 2/15/2 against him. I feel completely useless whatever i do, because i feel like he outdamages me, has more range, ignores my damage with his shields and i just absolutely hate playing against him, even in a favored matchup, such as gangplank.  


Anyways, i appreciate any tips you may have. (sorry for the rant about this champ he just annoyings me a ton)<|endoftext|>I personally don't see the point of the omnivamp it gives, it's just not that much, and instead of Ravenous Hunter and Taste of Blood, I prefer Second Wind, and Revitalize. I can't complain about the true damage, but I just can't make the best out of it. And I usually need something to keep them close when they are in my ult.


Opinions?<|endoftext|>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDQpORdYsbA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDQpORdYsbA)



Has anyone tried this or is this just troll?<|endoftext|>It is still in the game. Legit just makes the match-up a joke when I try to ult the guy solid 4 seconds after he cancels his charge and my ult just does nothing and causes me to die to a gank and lose my tower over it in a ranked match.<|endoftext|>Specifically: is he easy enough?  For context, I’ve been playing Morde for a while among many other champions like Aatrox, Yone, Zed, Talon, etc.  I love all these champions to death.  But all my friends beg me to play an “easier” champ if I want to climb.  But I don’t want to play garen or Annie or whatever.  I really enjoy Morde though, and I find he’s simpler than the others who require memorizing combos.  You think he’s a good champ to one trick to get out of low ELO, for the reason of him being mechanically simple (not necessarily him being busted or whatever)?  Or am I just missing some thing and he’s actually Uber complex insanely mechanically difficult lmao.<|endoftext|>This exist since the rework, why no one talk about it. And why it never been fixed.<|endoftext|>hello revenant i am studying mordekaiser in the jungle.
I think the champ is "particular" but has potential I'm very confused about the Build, Morde is a champion halfway between instant damage and "burst".
I tried both roket belt, night harvester, riftmaker and tank items (aegis and frostfire) they all have pros and cons in general.
Compared to the top, the jungler must be present for the objectives and the related team fights.
Riftmaker rush is good in 1v1 but if very exposed to the burst if they catch you in TF.
Night harvester / rocket belt are good items to burst the enemy early in the game, but you are more fragile.
Tank item ealry I guarantee you a good survival at the expense of having a good Power spike ealry which is not necessarily bad, but imitating the Jungle Position Early Game snowball is always a risky tactic.
I wanted to share these thoughts, and maybe get some feedback from other more experienced revenants as well!

Thx for help!<|endoftext|>Hey guys, hope everyone’s doing well and fine. First off, I’m interested in learning Morde due to his skin & so I could have an AP in my top champ pool. So here’s a quick question, when should I build Demonic Embrace, Rylai’s, or Cosmic Drive as a 2nd item? Also, what are your examples of your full build? Do you go full AP, balanced, or more on the tanky side? Thanks!<|endoftext|>Hey yall, new to the community but im thinking of buying a mordekaiser skin. My fav is dragon knight but it isn't available... anyone know when I can get it? If not whats the best mord skin?<|endoftext|>I miss that ability a lot and Morde's new kit feels too one-dimensional outside from the ultimate. This ability would also synergise pretty well with his passive, with the third Q activating it. The third Q building damage was just too cool tbh. Also I would make his W obsorb his passive (being unsusable when it's not up), but giving him extra shield (or remove shield for spellvamp) and damage  for ever champion hit(like is old W).<|endoftext|>Hiya, fellow Mordekaiser main here  


As this title says, i miss like 70% of my skills and i just wanted to ask if anyone has any tips on how to improve and such<|endoftext|>Got it from an orb that I got when I bought the pass. I think it was from the 3rd orb.


Just wanted to share it with others because my friends doesn't care because they say that Morde is a no skill braindead champ, meanwhile one of them plays Akali, a totally not broken and op champ, Veigar, who is totally not annoying af, Pyke who is definitely not strong, and Trundle who is not a nightmare to play against by any chance.


Anyway, I'm suprised that my ult haven't fried out my Pc yet, but sometimes when I do an E Q combo, my fps drops from a solid 60 to between 20 and 30. And I'm happy to see that other people get the skin too.<|endoftext|>

https://reddit.com/link/nrdrn4/video/6tgsax5m02371/player<|endoftext|>Hey does anyone know how reworked Mordekaiser looks without his helmet?<|endoftext|>Hi there!

None of you will know me, as I come from the faraway land of Bard mains, and even there nobody really knows me. 

However, I have come on a mission. I plan to find the most hated champ to play against, from the perspective of various different champion mains, OTPs, or just players in general. Over the next few weeks I will be working to send a survey to each individual champions subreddit, then compile them once I find that I have collected enough data. The compilation of surveys and results will then be submitted to the official League of Legends subreddit, for the community to take a closer look at.

If you would be so kind as to quickly fill out the attached Google form for me, it would make me so happy and I would thank you forever. 

[https://forms.gle/okfFrdsWM8zmHbvGA](https://forms.gle/okfFrdsWM8zmHbvGA)

Also feel free to state your reasoning in the comments of this post, as letting you do so on the form itself would blow this whole operation way out of proportion for this one-man job. 

Thank you very much, and I wish you best of luck in your future games!<|endoftext|>Hello I was wondering if there was any good mordekasier streamer on twitch?<|endoftext|>Ended up winning the game but laning phase was brutal.  Offhand, would going Fleet Footwork over Conqueror help out the laning phase?  It would provide:

&nbsp;

-MS to get to him

-Sustain to help with all the Q/barrel poke

&nbsp;

Since GP doesn't really let you sit on top of him like a tank or bruiser, Conqueror seems weak here.

&nbsp;

Any tips on how to play out the lane would also be appreciated.  Once he gets a slight health lead from Q spam he just sets up a barrel in the wave and last hits.<|endoftext|>Am i just dumb or is project mord not showing people outside your ult as little spirit bois cause normaly i can see them outside my ult when in a 1v1 and i know to back off but recently ive found i just cant see them inside ulty. am i goin insane or wht?<|endoftext|>This is just a rant, I am sick of having to play a 0 mobility juggernaut like an assassin dipping in and out of fights because even building full AP bruiser I get CC’d and bursted 100-0 instantly every time I enter a teamfight before I even get the chance to press R.

I feel like the champ is going to go through an identity crisis. We’re being pushed so far towards damage and so far away from tankiness that we’re going to become a 0 mobility assassin. Last season if I was ultrafed on morde, I could walk into a full team and survive for at least long enough to get a triple kill, even more if I played it well. This season, even 8-0 with 100cs at 12 mins I will be instant killed by a collective 3/0 varus/nautilus botlane if I don’t have team support.<|endoftext|>Though Morde counters Illaoi, I really have a bad time fighting her.

Has anyone else ever had this before? I was using project morde btw.<|endoftext|>It's literally like Zed's ultimate way back in the day when every marksman could QSS and he was pondering his existence.Also half the duration of zhonya's (Not stopwatch) in his ult. That way it's not a pain early, but AP assassins who go bonkers lategame can't bullshit their way out of it.

Make cleanse (the summoner spell) the only thing that can remove it, so it actually gives you more of a tactical advantage than "haha you have to spend extra gold now you fool!"

Result: ADCs have a way of not dealing with your shit, fighters now HAVE to deal with you and they can opt to make it a more even fight (via QSS removing the stat steal) and AP assassins (and GP) get what's coming to them.<|endoftext|>

[So, turns out, Sterak's Guage is usable on Morde with pretty good success. It isn't perfect, and has some flaws like no scaling on abilities, but the extra survivability, and extra damage on autos is a pretty nice perk considering Morde is pretty auto realiant due to his passive and ability cooldowns. This is Nexus Blitz, but I want to test it out on ranked soon.](https://preview.redd.it/aw3ua8bulw271.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=2eaf53e45acfeb3a3182fba8b0a1c4b21273d3aa)<|endoftext|>I played Fiora so that me, my brothers and their friends can use the entire IG slimline for fun, I had IG Fiora, so my brother literally got Fiora and the skin for it but

first off tabi since they are built a ton. with how strong adc's are and how strong ad champions in general are  tabi basically seems like a competent choice every game they're usually good for lane and should scale better than just armor stacking. However in my opinion and based on winrates tabi are pretty much a bait. when you go tabi you sacrifice the tenacity from mercs(sticking power) or the insane damage from sorcs. not only that but living longer in means nothing if you can't kill the adc or whoever else because you lack tenacity or damage. into heavy ad teamcomps building tabi is still the right call but in general i think they should be lower priority.

secondly zhonya's, don't get me wrong it feels AMAZING to build, you can buy the seekers for lane get extra cdr AP and armor gift wrapped with one of the best actives in the game for extremely cheap.  except its not really is it. while it feels good Zhonya's actually does very little for Mordekaiser (ofc in games where there are important ults you need to dodge it can still be ok I.E. veigo ult, diana ult, etc). the item provides less AP  than any other mage item and no health the sudo tankiness you get from the active can either be useless because you'll die without doing anything more anyway or detrimental if you're forced to use it in ult and have to stop dealing damage. having the actual extra tankiness from items like rylais and demonic provide a much larger spike and will result in a higher winrate. everytime you zhonya's you have to think that having 350 extra health and the ability to cast your spells would probably be better. as an added bonus gargoyle stoneplate is an extremely undervalued item if you can afford it. while you cannot buy it second getting it third or fourth item while having 2.5 k + hp provides a similar effect as zhonya's except you can move and cast spells as well.

TLDR lean into the ap bruiser and build sorcs/mercs, and just buy rylais demonic and gargoyle instead of investing into zhonya's.<|endoftext|>Let me make this clear. Mordekaiser is really fun! I got the dude M7 and he was my go-to in season 10 before I decided to one-trick Urgot. He feels SO good with a lead, too, and you can feel nigh-unstoppable, but with him I feel like his design is really suffering in this meta due purely to his item selection and kit limitations.

I think Morde has *two* problems.

• His poor ability to gap-close, something he suffers  with worse than any of his peers in toplane this season due to the addition of Stride breaker. While Morde feels great if they're engaging onto you with Rift and Demonic, theres simply too many champs where chasing them is simply a waste of time.

• He's too item reliant. It is only his items that give him stickiness and stop him from blowing up in teamfights. This is due to how, for a champion as big and slow as he is, his only actual form of innate sustain/dmg mitigation is his W, and besides his E he has no way to *remain* close to them without something like Rylais.

These problems kind of feed into each other! And make Mordekaiser feel kind of binary. Into poor and even so-so comps for Morde he can and will often get kited to oblivion, with dashes, cc, item actives, summs, it makes it surprisingly difficult for Morde to actually kill people if they play with him in mind. This makes it harder for Mordekaiser to get items, which makes it easier to get away from him and easier for him to explode. What this results in is either Mordekaiser got enough gold to get his items so he's HORRIFYING, or he didn't get enough gold to get his items so he's only a threat if he's allowed to walk all over your team while somehow not dead or near-to by the time he gets there.

Pretty easy to identify, so how do we fix this? Well we have a few ways to address this: give him ways to deal with peel which would remove counterplay, OR make him less item reliant. I prefer the latter, and I feel we can look at other toplaners for guidance!

*NEW* His E on catching someone will slow them for 1 second by 50%. Scaling the slow duration or strength with levels seems kind of risky and it might be too easy to catch people if it got all the way to 2.25.

Kinda like a Darius yank, but what Darius has is that it brings them closer AND stuns them for a tiny bit longer than Morde does. But he still explodes in teamfights if he isn't ahead. What do we do? We can go two ways. Hurt more, to dish out more punishment when you get onto someone, or get tankier so you can take more punishment for your team. I prefer the ladder since that way it's more team-oriented AND you will better be able to withstand poke.

*NEW* After getting a takedown in his Ult, he gains 4/6/9 Armor/MR, as well as 40/60/80HP. This equates to around ~220 gold's worth of stats on a takedown at level 6. Lategame these stats honestly won't matter as much into most teamcomps and champs in the game with the buffing of Black Cleaver, the existence of Lord Dominiks and the %hp damage that botrk, liandrys, demonic all give. By comparison this is SIGNIFICANTLY more gold value than Chogath ult level 6 when it comes to Gold efficiency, but Chogath also has significantly better item synergy, and ability synergy between the ability hitboxes getting larger as well as a bigger execute.

Maybe reduce some of his base damage with Q at higher levels to make him more a Frontliney Tank that happens to be *really* good at melting other tanks, and keep his struggles with engaging or getting onto backline? Make him scarier in a team fight midgame as a tank melter rather since his itemization is suffocatingly limited and only half as versatile.

These are just my thoughts as someone who feels that Morde hurts way too much and dies too easily when focused kind of going against his visual as BIG, SLOW, CHUNKY.

I spent way too long on this.<|endoftext|>And how do we get them?<|endoftext|>Yeah! fiora, this match is very difficult for me i play aggressive in every game but how i need to play vs fiora? in the last game vs fiora she destroyed me and in the 2nd last i win her but... only because all my team camps in my line and we fight 5v1 xD, EY!

The sound effects themselves are mostly great, it's a futuristic skin so obviously it won't have the metallic bonks that the base skin has, but playing the skin feels like something happened with its sounds as it got shipped from pbe to live.

Not a big issue by itself, but there is also one more thing. I mentioned this in another thread already but there also seems to be a bit of a disparity between his isolated Q sfx where one sounds [pretty satisfying](https://youtu.be/jv8t4nM6qsc?t=105) despite the lower volume, but then some others [sound slightly less intense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv8t4nM6qsc&t=107s) (these sound differences have no relation with passive stacks, experimented a bit with stacked passive on practice tool and nothing changed compared to this video).

Still a good skin of course (probably the best Morde has right after base), just really hoping these sound issues are bugs that can be fixed in a future patch because they are holding Project Morde back from being truly great (especially since it's a Legendary).<|endoftext|>Found it on twitter.

While a Sett or Darius can run down ADCs with Stridebreaker<|endoftext|>I’m thinking 8” minimum<|endoftext|>160 ap isn't that hard to reach without taking drastic measures. From runes, the item, doran's ring and a dark seal you are already at 123. Now throw in a oblivion orb (which is almost as cost efficient as bramble at this point) assuming you need it and a couple ds stacks and you are already there. Even if you don't get all that, conqueror will give you the passive ms in long trades and your r will often benefit from the full 40 ah.



I think mobility is what he needs more than anything. Omnivamp is one third as effective with aoe so you don't benefit much in combat and your w can heal you to full out of combat as well. I'm going cosmic into sunfire/iceborn and it feels kinda nuts.<|endoftext|>I want to start off by saying that I LOVE the new Morde Skin, I love the colors and I love the ultimate and how he looks in it. One of my main issues with it and I don't know if it's just me or if anyone else has noticed this but I feel like the autoing animation seems really slow, when I E Q auto sometimes it doesn't even play.

I mean, like, think think<|endoftext|>Riot went all out for the voice lines for the Project Korde skin in terms of not just acting quality but content. Morde quotes all sorts of famous historical figures like Alexander Pope ("to err is human") one of my favorites Neville Chamberlain ("Peace in our time") and even refers to Asimovs Laws for robots. Seriously cool historical connections and even better voice acting<|endoftext|>I feel like this patch has brought a lot attention to Mordekaiser, ok project morde is sick as fuck, but i fear for the worst that riot is going to nerf him for no reason<|endoftext|>Hi lvl 6 Mordekaiser here, I'm practicing Mordekaiser and I was against an Urgot and got stomped real hard. I wanted to know how do I go against him.<|endoftext|>If he is not bad he will just not die early, and from then its lost. Especially in low elo (gold) where if Im not the one stopping the split push no one will. Ganks to him are also free kills for him. Yes, I can kill the jungler with my ult, but then trynda can easilly kill me with his "i dont wanna die lol" outplay button. Might start banning him instead of fiora as his playrate seems to be skyrocketing.  


 Pd.: holding all the shit talk I wanna throw to this champion was... difficult<|endoftext|>I always find this weird when i see recommended item sets for mordekaiser. Like is there some trick with hourglass on Mordekaiser, or is this just for going against assassins?<|endoftext|>Maybe us for my time at league, but I find this season worse that the tank meta. I face the same champions, with the same builds and the same strats. I'm not even hight elo (Plat 4).

I play Morde mid and is usually Sylas, on Jungle, Diana or Khazix. And botlane, Tristana, Caitlyn or Kaisa.

And every game is a dice roll with 3 options. My botlane feeded at min 4/They got fed at their own/ Or they played passive and I helped them to carry.

Is exhausting and I want to know what do you think and what you did if you feel the same.<|endoftext|>Had a recent game and it just stuck with me.  I was laning vs Darius, no problem, Poked him down with my Qs, took tower, was up maybe 4-1 when first tower dropped.  

So my mid laner (Veigar) was feeding the hell out of Sylas, so I asked if we could switch, and I get the "STFU NOOB" type of shit.  So I said, hey top tower is down, you can freeze the lane and just farm up your Q, win-win, and again, I get the "you don't know what you're talking about" type of thing. 

Okay...next plan!

So my bot lane was also feeding, shocker, I'm not making this up.  

So then I think, okay, let me push the 2nd tower, and hell even the 3rd tower.  Get a rift and press on.  Before I do that, I tell them, "hey I'm going to aggressively push top, because I know their top can't stop me, and they'll have to send 3 people at least to deal with me."  So I ward as best I can to track em and proceed forward. 



Sure enough, they send 3 people, I kill two and die to the third person.  No issues.  I look at the map again; my jg is on our wolves (not contesting the other team taking dragon with 1 or 2 people max), my mid lane is just randomly farming CS.  My bot lane must be busy thinking like "what does a ward do?"

 They did nothing to help with objectives.  

So then I attempted to group, yeah right, all that meant was I'm eating 3-4 ults and dying just about the time I get into EQ range. 



So I was literally left wondering, what the hell can I do to get us this win?  With like 320 CS and I don't know 27k gold I had been maxed out build wise. 



We lost.. 

I am asking here because I really want to move up again in league, I was high gold/low plat, took a long break off, and now I'm grinding back up the ladder.  But this season, seems to be very, very, VERY difficult for me.  I know we can't win every game, but god damn I was so far ahead, like I'm level 18, they're level 14-15.   



By the time we finished, they were mainly level 17/18, while the rest of my time was sitting at 15/16.  So it was really really bad how far under leveled they were, with little CS/gold. 



Any tips or should I just mark it up to "bad luck, try again!"<|endoftext|>I mean, I loved rainbow since it looks so clean. and u?<|endoftext|>The new skin. Is it honestly that good? Because the way I see it is that it is a huge disappointment FOR ME. I play morde for his personality, I want to feel like I'm gonna rip the soul from my enemy when I see them in lane but with this skin, I just feel like I'm a robot that doesn't like things. And the fact that his voice sounds like shit doesn't help either. Wish it were more like Vaynes skin, the same voice actor, and as close as how she acted with the base skin. I don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking it.<|endoftext|>idk if im the only person that this kinda bothers, but its the same reason i dont really like dark star morde. dont get me wrong, theyre both objectively great skins but theres something that missing from them. that statisfying crushing sound from landing a solo Q in all of his other skins aside from these two. idk, the hit sound just feel so much weaker and less satisfying imo. its something that bothered me about dark star and wish they wouldve addressed in project, but whatever, im just nitpicking<|endoftext|>I'm relatively new to the champ (60k points) and I've been having a really hard time trying to carry as Mordekaiser. I feel like I can do well in lane but out of it I don't understand what my role is supposed to be. I can't go into a fight face first because I get bursted down so easily, and my ult makes my role in team fights very confusing, especially when the person I need to ult has QSS so I'm forced to ult someone less important. I just wish I could carry my teams like how a fed Viego can 1v4 every game.<|endoftext|>After a lot of testing and tweaking, I run the following build:

Runes: Conq, Triumph, Alacrity/Tenacity, Coup - Magical Footwear, Approach Velocity

Items: Rylai's, Riftmaker, Boots, Gargoyles, Cosmic, Demonic

Why are we using inspiration runes? Magical footwear acts as a little bit of insurance if you don't manage to snag a kill early or fall behind. It also gives +10 MS. Approach velocity is the biggest reason, after completing Rylai's (at around 10-13 mins), you'll not only perma slow, but you'll be fast as hell, removing any chance of being out kited (land something first). 

I find that taking Rylais before Rift is better, simply because of how weak the mythic passive is without having a few items.

The rest is standard Morde itemization. This is built with jungling taken into account, and to ease his lack of mobility as a juggernaut. What do you guys think?<|endoftext|>I’ve been thinking about the state of Morde’s ult and conditions for stealing stats. I know that he’s in a pretty good spot right now but considering the stat steal until the enemy respawns condition is very situational I was wondering what other morde mains might think about a permanent 2 or 3% stat steal every time you kill someone in the death realm. 

Let me know viable you think this is. :)<|endoftext|>This post was an excellent idea, even if a little bit meme https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ndb8iu/suggestion_allow_morde_to_self_cast_his_ult/. Would make for a really cool Realm-warm mechanic, and potentially give some defenses if allowed to be used during combat. 

The gameplay implications are phenomenal, I really would like Riot to consider it if the devs sometimes check out our subreddit. 

Morde self-cast (click on portrait only, don't want to make R on opponents a mouse-accuracy test). Have to be out of combat maybe, or alternatively duration of realm-warm is halved when used while in combat? Self-cast would then give the following buffs: 

- Gives Morde greatly increased Death-Realm Range.
- Morde gains a speedboost (same as passive when active)
- Can terminate R at will, or force the max duration to give opponents time for counterplay. 

Thoughts?<|endoftext|>Hi y'all, 

Started playing Mord again, I used to main him many years ago.  Anyway, had a question about his E,   I can land it find and all, but I notice that it puts things behind me.

\-I remade the spreadsheet to be cleaner and more organized (Old one hidden in case you all want it)

\-Replaced Bramble with Oblivion Orb in healing matchups (Bramble nerfs too hard)

\-Morellonomicon added in builds against heavy healing enemies (Better than thronmail if armor not required)

\-New Items Import <|endoftext|>Some time ago I saw people thinking what to do with Morde, since his weakest ability is W, and his R only give him stats for seconds, depending on game stage and it is not that useful.

As we all know, Morde cannot keep stats forever, cuz it will be too OP on long lasting games. (I mean 10%)

But what if he got smth similar to Kindred stacks? For example: killing someone give him stats (temporary) but also a stack for W! (eternal!)  
There are many ways of what could it be: HP, better HP to shield scaling, even MS per stack. (Stacking infinitely, which is not good, cuz you can grab each time a support, so even if the value of buffs were small, you can get very strong with small cost.)  
Or - what I think is better - stacking it up to 5, per champion, like runes.  
Killing enemy in R would give you for example 2% Armor&MR on active W. Why on W? To make it really "INDESTRUCTIBLE" ability. 

I think it is not broken:  
\- You still need to grab each of the enemy, so you prioritize if you want another stack or better chance to win teamfight/duel/etc.  
\- Buffs are still temporary (W cooldawn is pretty long cuz usually you hold shield instead of consuming it)  
\- People buy QSS and it can happen that you never get stacks from a particular champion  
\- VS tanky champs there's a chance you won't get stack anyway (also high mechanic players like ADC...)  


 In addition, it seems to me that this completes the image of the "harvest of souls", and giving real meaning to the name of W ability.

look to E her, she often responds with W trying to stun me, Morde E comes back up sooner ( gotta love the league wiki ) so i just dodge back and abuse this.

she does max health true dmg, but armor still works well vs her, i just poke her too much and get too tanky for her to actually kill, i might not be able to kill her often, but if their jungle makes a mistake during a gank, i collect them double buffs and apply even more pressure, while my jgl gets all the drakes.<|endoftext|>

Is this because of the new skin?


I myself started playing Mordekaiser because I got tired of Aatrox and got hyped up by the new Project skin. I personally like Mordekaiser because I like his abilities, and I found a way to play him that I enjoy, but today I only went bot, because out of 5 matches, Mordekaiser was banned by the enemy toplaners in all the matches.


If he wasn't banned in other matches, as soon as the enemy saw me picking Mordekaiser dodged, or Morde was picked before me.


I get it, Mordekaiser's pickrate suddenly became higher because people got hyped up, me too, but why only now? This whole situation just seems so out of nowhere.


And the most annoying thing is that I couldn't play Mordekaiser today In a non co-op match because he was either banned, picked before me, or the enemy just decided to dodge when I picked Morde.<|endoftext|>Found a few recent vods but looking to see games from someone regularly.<|endoftext|>Everyone here is whining about an ability on a new champ being similar to one taken out of the game 3 years ago meanwhile I’m happy mundo won’t autowin vs Morde late because the 45% bonus mr passive is gone from E<|endoftext|>Pretty cool if you ask me.<|endoftext|>What do u think about new mundo rework that just dropped u think he will counter morde or not?<|endoftext|>bruh<|endoftext|>it's not that project is bad it's just that dark star is already too good<|endoftext|>Mordekaiser was once responsible for over 80% of the bugs that League had.

On top of the physical aspect, the Program's consciousness is like HAL-9000, a security program taken too far. This makes his code bugged as well.

\-But the important thing about this is the build that I started using with Mordekaiser. First, I love the ignite on top. It is very cool to see how any fighter tries to trade and you win for having ignite, it is an excellent spell and a lot of fun (and more because people tick off saying things like \`\` what do you do using ignite in top?

And then the cosmic drive. A few weeks ago I had seen a comment on reddit where it said that this is the second best item on mordekaiser. and I think that, after several games in my two accounts, it is true (although I am willing to continue testing builds)

And when is the PROJECT event coming to live servers?<|endoftext|>im confused. is this a glitch in the system or is there a valuable reasoning for this? pls help.

Just recently I’ll be staying in NA for about 2 months and a friend of mine gave his account which has 0 champions that I usually play from my own account. The only champion that I enjoyed overall from kit, lore, and skins is Mordekaiser. The reason I haven’t touched on morde or learn top is because back home I would generally play with my friends and have a duo adc so I just focused all of my time playing support or jungle. So can I ask some advice on some build, runes, skill order and general advice on top lane? Thank you very much! :)<|endoftext|>i want somebody to tell me how to kill these stupid fiora mains as a mordekaiser main

<|endoftext|>I see videos, where you guys are getting pentakills, but I can't even beat a Sion or Azir top.


I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Is it the matchups, the builds? Or is it just me? I love Mordekaiser's abilities, his character, his lore.


When I started playing Morde, it was all good, I had kills above 11, and I rember when I was in blind I easily played 1v2 against a Nasus and Illaoi. Or when I was Morde top, and my friend Yone mid, he nearly had 30 kills, and I almost had 20.


But in general, I'm not playing that good. My friends like to joke about me being bad or dumb (or at least I hope they are joking). They are right, there are times when I'm not thinking, I just do stuff, but I'm often  just doing my best.


And when I wasn't feeding, I got called out for playing champs that don't take so much skill, or just strong in general. Like when I was playing Garen. I always had a good k/d, but I got called out for playing him.


And when go up on social media and see other people's pentakills, I always feel jealous.


And it's so frustrating to see  "Ignores turrets" "bad vision" "passive laner" ect. on Porofessor, and the only good thing it says is "Mordekaiser lover" and "unkillable laner" by now.


Don't get me wrong, it's good to see that other players who like the same champ that I like, playing good, and I'm impressed by you guys, but at the same time I'm sad because I'm not so good as others.<|endoftext|>Playing a game and the enemy daruis had 3 hits on me and a mordikaiser ulted the Darius just before Darius ulted me. Thank you sighed a soraka main.<|endoftext|>Soo remember that moment in the Project Teaser? When Mordekaiser grabs nightfall?

[Here is it.](https://preview.redd.it/f95083uw2j071.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a7d141b4252a29a33cca6f8e9e62c444344b658c)



Soo judging by this shot, i guess that IF we get a cinematic or some kind of animation, there is a chance that the cinematic countinues from here.



And by judging that its a legendary skin, and by the voice lines you can kinda theorize that he is the main antagonist of the story of project.



Or i can also say that if you watch the official skins theme which i will link here, its a little remix of all the Project events. Judging by that i can guess that its the end. He is like the final boss of Project.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDu-\_iL5tBc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDu-_iL5tBc)



This could be the first time morde appearing in a cinematic.

like c'mon we all know how good is the cinematic team at riot! xD



whatever you think THIS IS JUST A THEORY nothing is confirmed or anything.<|endoftext|>Been grinding out Morde recently, and I’ve been wondering what some counters are for Morde in the jungle, or just for Morde in general. Usually I ban Shaco, since I don’t have enough brain power to try and play his guessing game, but I’d love to know any other champs to watch out for.<|endoftext|>Just to know...<|endoftext|>I mean riftmaker are good but making him frist are rly bad in my opinion becuse morde dont have good srvivality on top and armor did i should rush ramble vest with tabi boots and then riftmaker or ramble west and start making riftmaker<|endoftext|>Seriously.  How do I lose every time?  This monkey fuck builds no magic resist and still some how takes NO damage. The hell am I supposed to do?  I've tried tank.  Nope, he kills me.  So what gives?<|endoftext|>At what rank does Mordekaiser stop being viable?<|endoftext|>How you do against this champ, she ou trade you at every stage of the game and you can't even farm under tower with that bs poison<|endoftext|>Ok so I’ve been a morde main for a while now and haven’t rly bothered zooming in on his character model until I wanted to get a better look at him with the project skin on so I tried him out in pbe, so I zoomed in and noticed morde is packing some heat (in the rear) and I wan wondering if anything in his lore has to do with him packing this heat, not I’m not one to stare but it gets a little distracting in game when I’m trying to cs and I see Mordekaisers massive cake.<|endoftext|>Does anyone know of some high elo mordekaisers to watch? I'm looking for Mordekaiser main preferably.<|endoftext|>Is it just me or does the E skill on Project Morde feel "off"? Like it feels like the pull has a bit of a delay to it than the base skin and all the other skins for that matter. I dont know if others feel the same way or am I the weird one here.<|endoftext|>a man can dream.<|endoftext|>Hello everyone, I would like to know how to play against this annoying champion! I can't kill and if I start a fight against him I can't even escape without being swallowed TO DEATH. I can't take it anymore, please someone HELP ME 😳👉🏻👈🏻<|endoftext|>When does it come out and how much does it cost?<|endoftext|>What u prefer guys after riftmaker? I think about zhonya but demonic embrance can be better idk what is best option after riftmaker i think sometimes about morelnicon or rylai<|endoftext|>Is the extra armor and magic resist worth? I figured the exploding attack stacks from sunfire could help with lost damage due to not taking rift while increasing your tankiness and giving tenacity. Or should I just stick to riftmaker?<|endoftext|>I like this build a lot. Yes it isn't full AP and is quite tanky but we are not building squishy armor/mr items. Mordekaiser is a Juggernaut, which is why I don't like no HP items on him such as Nashor's and Zhonya's. Become unkiteable like a Flash + Ghost full Tenacity Darius. Perma slow everyone with Rylai's and keep Riftmaker up permanently. 

Spells: Flash + Ghost

Runes: Conqueror + Triumph + Tenacity + Last Stand and Second Wind + Unflinching

Build: Riftmaker + Boots + Rylai's + Deadmans/Force of Nature + Deadmans/Force of Nature + Steraks (yes it's AD but Morde auto attacks a lot and gives a great shield, Phage passive also helps in teamfights.)<|endoftext|>As the title says.

I recently started playing Morde to win those sweet 1v1s. Played a game into Irelia. I know that Morde should win Irelia and the win rate reflects that but I couldn't land anything on her and lost lane because of that. I imagine I'd have the same struggle fighting other mobile champions like Yasuo too.<|endoftext|>

On my main account I am on Silver II 44 lp (and my high elo was silver I 32 lp) and then on my smurf account I am on Silver III with 53 lp if I remember correctly.

Then I want to know if I should continue playing it top (It should be noted that I am not otp mordekaiser, I only main it. I also play sett, cho'gath and sometimes tryndamere)



I feel that, it would be easier to climb elo with mordekaiser in the jg due to the lack of experience in this role in low elo. The problem is that I play afk farming jungles, like Amumu up to level 6, and sometimes master yi. And with jungle mordekaiser I do exactly the same, I stay afk farming and only gank if I see it very free. So i don't know if that's a good playstyle with jungle mordekaiser or should I play it more aggressive.

 and in the topline if I play more to push line and rotate with my jg if I can do it.

P.S: And I don't know if it has something to do with it but I'm from the LAS server and sometimes I also play in BR 

P.S.2:  thanks for the future answers, I hope ToT<|endoftext|>I know he spikes at 6, and at riftmaker but what other spikes does he have?
Does he spike at certain levels, something like Urgot level 9/11/13?
Or is he just completely reliant on his ult?<|endoftext|>Is full tank Morde viable? If yes, which items are the core for this build?<|endoftext|>I am a main mordekaiser top, so this is simple. Phase rush vs kite champions is a good option? Mainly because of Tristana, I think it's too annoying and from my point of view it is almost impossible to get close even inside the r, because she uses the W and in case it was not enough launch her r and if you don't have flash you just have a bad time.



So I was wondering if phase rush would be a good option just to be able to get close to these types of champions, without having a chance to kite. But I'm not so sure because of the rune nerf.



\-PD: if you're wondering why I don't ban her, it's because champions like yone, vayne or Kai'sa seem even more annoying to me.<|endoftext|>Mordekaiser is decent a counter pick against tanks in general, cause of his magic penetration and the fact that tanks can't kite him.
But if u have to play into high mobility champs it becomes nearly impossible to reach them, considering they play well. 
In general Mordekaiser is way slower then other juggernauts. The fact that he can't use stridebraker like Garen or Darius makes him less successful in general. 
My solution would be 
A: Buff Mordekaisers Ms by 5
B: Make his e animation faster by levels so he can actually pull the enemy carry in the late game
C: Buff passive Ms by 7

What do you Brazilians think about my thoughts?
Is Morde actually fine or are some buffs necessary?<|endoftext|>Hello everyone, I play mordekaiser on every role excluding ADC. I'm here to share some of my strats with you.

Hail of Blades (Mid / Top / Jungle)
This rune is a little bit weird, but trust me on this. This give morde a very, VERY, level strong level 1-2. He is already very strong, but with hob i believe he is more than viable in the midlane. but, if your opponent makes the mistake of going in on you, you have - ignite, 3 borderline instant auto-attacks a Q to follow up with, and a pull to get them next to you if they try to run away afterwards, especially if you are in the middle lane where opponents are much more squishy. For this tree i recommend - 
Hail of Blades
Taste of Blood
Eyeball Collection
Ravenous Hunter
The next tree is dependent on your opponent. If it a matchup that requires bone plating, use it with revitalize. If it is more of a duelist matchup, use Coup de Grace with Legend: Alacrity. As for items, I usually just go the standard Riftmaker build, but there is probably a crazy setup to use. Maybe Rocketbelt, Cosmic Drive, Crystal Scepter, Nashor's Tooth, Lich Bane, and Sorcerer's Shoes. No clue how that could work though. Would definitely be a guarenteed kill in the death realm.

Grasp of the Undying (Top / Mid)
Once again, not a rune you usually see, but mordekaiser has a very similar sustain to tahm kench, the main difference being mordekaiser does not have a resource bar. This allows him to stay in lane for however long his HEALTH permits. So, why not build off that?
Grasp of the Undying
Shield Bash
Second Wind
Revitalize
Taste of Blood
Ravenous Hunter
This build allows you to simultaneously abuse mordekaiser's built-in magic pen and also his W shield scaling. With this, it's smart to just stick to tank items with demonic embrace. You are VERY hard to kill with this build.

Glacial Augment (Jungle / Support)
Before you click off, allow me to explain. with this build, you strictly need to prioritize movement-speed limiting items. This makes chilling smite useful.
Glacial Augment
Footwear
Future's Market
Approach Velocity
Conditioning
Overgrowth

I have never really tried this whole build before, but here goes.
Frostfire Gauntlet, Crystal Scepter, Cosmic Drive, Morellonomicon, Dead Man's Plate, Boots of Swiftness. If you are playing support, skip dead man's plate or morellonomicon depending on your team composition. 

Anyways let me know what you guys think. I really think mordekaiser has areas he excels at than just conqueror.<|endoftext|>Yes, I am becoming a Mordekaiser main because of the best skin in the entire game.

And yes, I am brazilian.<|endoftext|>I see most people go merc threads against morde, but this does not seems reasonable to me as tenacity doesn't affect his E AFAIK. Going merc just for 25 MR seems a straight neg<|endoftext|>so i was curious about a build pattern and never really tried it that much. And i saw someone going this perticular build and i tried it but i'm not so sure about it.  
The build is like this: Demonic Embrace - Sunfire Aegis - Zonya/ Thornmail<|endoftext|>You know, those bugs like the recall animation not working, or the passive not giving conqueror stack when activated by an ability, or the R getting canceled by almost every ability in the game...<|endoftext|>Is it just me or do the project Mordekaiser Chromas look incredible in game but look very bad in like screen shots?

Just asking :)<|endoftext|>It sounds insane, but i actually think mordekaiser is the worst champion in the game. You can get fed 10/0 and still be irrelevant because AP bruiser items are trash and all that takes to stop him from 1v5ing is an olaf Q slow or a galeforce proc. Also enemy carry can rush sash/zhonyas and make your ult useless on them.  Can r/mordekaisermains tell me why this champ is worth playing over most other better top laners? What does he do that many other top laners don't? Would genuinely like to know.<|endoftext|>Basically title. Something I picked up when listening to the special interactions is that the voice has similarly disrupted sound frequencies as rasputin from D2.<|endoftext|>So, as the title might suggest, this is about Gargoyle's stoneplate on mordekaiser. Frankly in my opinion probably the single most underrated mordekaiser item in the game.

The first time I built it was when I was up against a fed enemy caitlyn, in death realm using zhonyas was basically a death sentence, and thus I swapped it for stoneplate. Holy shit I love this item

My normal build is Riftmaker-Demonic embrace-tabi/merc boots-spirit visage-thornmail-stoneplate. This build gets you around 3.5K hp with nearly 200 magic resist and a bit over 200 armor. That's all well and good, but the best bit about it is simply the synergy

At level 18, with a fully maxed w and taking spirit visage into account, your W shields for about a thousand hp when fully stacked. Stoneplate also seems to be affected by spirit visage, and that shield gets up to 1500 health in size. If you time it well, you can pop two 1K+ shields successively, or a 2.5K health shield all at once, whilst leaving you open to using abilities and positioning yourself unlike with zhonyas.

I will add, as a counterpoint. It does leave you open to cc, and the AP from zhonyas will mean you do a bit less damage, but for the sheer tankiness that stoneplate provides. It's well worth the trade off

tl;dr, try supping zhonyas out for stoneplate once in a while. It's well worth it<|endoftext|>So I am pretty new to Morde and I have been heavily enjoying him. I want to really climb with him but I am having a hard time finding a rune set and a core build that works with him. I have seen multiple different runes and core builds for him but which has the most carry potential.

I am in lower elo currently and want to 1v9 as Morde. Any tips for him or guides would be amazing!<|endoftext|>title<|endoftext|>One of the best feelings from a long time, I killed the dude 8 times in lane, and was 4 Levels above him. Also I won a 1v3 against her and the enemy jungler and mid. Such a good feeling. And then she says that Mordekaiser is op when they are playing with the 4 dashes no cd champ Lmao.<|endoftext|>It would be kind of cool if his phrases about first, second and third law would be when he upgrades his ult to first, second and third lvl, just a little thought while watching his interactions, and he wouldn't repeat them from time to time while game goes on, it's doesn't sound right when he suppresses first law like 5 times per match<|endoftext|>Title basically<|endoftext|>Is he really that weak in lane? Doesn't really matter who I'm against, it just feels like I can't fight anyone while in lane. And if I get ganked, and killed, might as well just open top, because coming back from that feels devastating.

[OP.GG](https://OP.GG) does say he gets better as the game goes on, but then also says he's good into early lane bullies like Renekton and Garen, but loses to hyperscaling champs like Trynd and Gangplank?

Like.....what? And to make it worse, I've laned against several Trynds as Morde, and while I fucking hate the champion in general no matter who I'm playing, it feels even worse on Morde.

This champ is kind of confusing me. Anyone able to help me out?<|endoftext|>I know that Morde is supposed to be a toplaner, but I see people take him to jungle, even to mid or make him a support if someone is really trying to have fun with crazy ideas.


What I see is just people trying out crazy ideas, or Morde is actually good for positions other than top lane?


I gotta' ask here because I'm already having problems with builds, because I heard that people take Fleet Footwork against ranged toplaners, or people take Night Harvest isntead of Riftmaker in Jungle, Grasp instead of Conqueror on top, ect.<|endoftext|>So you want to learn Mordekaiser, huh? Take it from me, hardstuck draft pick player, that this is no easy task.

Playing Mordekaiser is about 3 things.  


1. MAXIMUM AGGRESSION
2. See No. 1
3. See No. 2

What do I mean by, "Maximum Aggression?" Well, it's simple. Full cock, rock hard at ALL TIMES. Never go flaccid. Don't even THINK about going flaccid.   
Mordekaiser's most valuable tool is intimidation.  
When you go full rock-hard cockular at some dipshit silver player, he loses his nerve and starts playing button mash simulator. This is what you want. Oh, and also some combos:

E + Q: self explanatory  
Q + Flash: When you start your Q channel, you pick a spot, and at the end of the channel, you will Q towards that spot from your current location. This has many implications, but it also means you can flash at the instant before your channel ends to surprise fuck somebody with an iso Q.  
E + R: Your R channels for 0.5 seconds, **slowing the enemy by 75%** then banishes you and the enemy for 7 seconds. You steal 10% of their total stats for the duration - (HP, AS, AD, AP, Armor, MR). You can utilize this slow to guarantee an E on the enemy.

That's all. Build AP and tank stats<|endoftext|>They good or nah?

To fix this "problem", I think that when Morde kills someone in the death realm, the killed person's camera stays in the death realm and the island they fought on disappears. This would make it seem like their soul now belongs to Morde Nation and is stuck in the death realm as part of the collection. This will give people time to admire and actually notice the detail in the background of his ultimate.<|endoftext|>I usually try to ult the enemy team's most annoying champs (e.g.: fed assassin/ADC) and kill them, but my team still struggles to survive somehow, so I find myself in a 1v3 or 1v4 afterwards.

I genuinely like new Morde but I think the champ needs more meat on his bones for flavor and fun. Plus this has the added benefit of having marrying the old aspects of morde I miss with the new. The following is also a conversion of a word document so the formatting could be way off [https://d.docs.live.net/1203b7283bcbac62/Documents/Morde%20mini%20rework%20ideav2.docx](https://d.docs.live.net/1203b7283bcbac62/Documents/Morde%20mini%20rework%20ideav2.docx) here is the original document.

**Passive: Gravelord** 

Mordekaisers auto attacks now function on a three hit rotation deal increasing magic damage. 

Additionally, Champions that suffer damage from Mordekaiser are cursed.

1st: deals bonus damage  
 2nd: damage is increased further.

3rd: Mordekaiser winds up nightfall and cleaves in a cone in front of him dealing heavy magic damage.

If mordekaiser kills an enemy afflicted with the curse they will be risen as a Lich. The Lich will auto attack the enemy mordekaiser is currently engaged with; additionally, while the lich is active mordekaiser gains increased movement speed and empowers Nightfall’s damage and passive auto attack damage.

\[the logic here is that all enemies slain will be a default ghost that will only deal a very light amount of damage and apply mordekaisers passive. So the ‘ghost’ would effectively act as nothing but a walking buff (honestly I considered them not auto attacking and just buffing up morde while hanging out from behind, which sounds way scarier to me and more like what new mordekaiser would do). I think this would make a lot of people happy since it keeps the fun thematic of having an undead army but keeps mordekaiser as a selfish warlord who consolidates power to himself.\]



**Q- Nightfall** 

Mordekaiser winds up and swings his mace downwards dealing damage and stunning and enemy for .10 seconds. Dealing increased damage when hitting a single target. This ability deals increased damage based on how many liches mordekaiser currently controls.

\[I genuinely enjoy this ability and how it functions, so I decided to leave this one alone.\]



**W- Harvester of Souls** 

Mordekaiser summons a storm of metal around his body dealing damage over time and gaining movement speed, Mordekaiser stores a portion of damage delt and taken while this ability is active. 

Reactivate: Mordekaiser snaps the storm by into his body dealing damage and gaining a shield based on the stored damage and for enemy champion hit. This ability deals less damage to minions.

\[ this is one of the more commonly requested changes, however I figured the healing was overrated and the shield is way more fun and feels more morde like. I did think that maybe the ability could be cashed in for a shield for damage delt, but I think basing it off champions hit is far more useful\]

**E- Deathfire Grasp** 

Unchanged I like this spell.



R- **Realm of Death**

Mordekaiser targets an enemy and drags them into minta rachun summoning a lich and increasing mordekaisers, hp, ability power, and Gravelord curse damage. If mordekaiser slays the enemy within the lich will fuse with the slain enemy bolstering its abilities and the benefits it provides Mordekaiser.

\[I figured adding a summoned ghost in the death realm would thematically feel really cool since its mordes domain, same reason I think mordes buffs in the realm should be a self-buff instead of stealing stats since it is a lot of hidden power and does not do much late game.\]  
   
 

This is not meant as anything serious, but a series of ideas that I have had while playing morde and thinking about what made me so attached to him in the first place. I loved the idea that he had so much brutal damage and whenever you were in the lead you truly felt like an unstoppable lord of death. I honestly would not mind if mordekaiser had cosmetic ghosts only to be honest, but I feel like a generic summon he earns after killing an enemy that gives him bonus power would play into his theme a lot. Having servants that he is more than capable without but when they are around, they only server to make mordekaiser stronger and do not act as their own force.<|endoftext|>

First back is boots and a blasting wand for a Nashor's Tooth.

Build the Nashor's and start building on a Frostfires and then a Visage.

Once that's done, hear me out on this one, okay? Build a Sterak's. For some reason, Steraks works real good with the item combo so far. From there, build what you want, really, but I follow the standard tank set up, with a Gargoyles or whatever I need at the time.

Ganks are okay, but your dueling is off the charts, plus eventually you command such a presence that it doesn't really matter. You're tanky, you auto fast, you deal shitloads of damage.

It's real fun, tbh, I recommend it. 7/10<|endoftext|>Morde is just so fucking broken that it requires 8k gold just to be on even gold with morde. 

With 8k gold i mean 8k of pure magic resist tank items.<|endoftext|>I started playing Mordekaiser because I got hyped up by the new project skins, but I started playing Leauge in early 2020 so couldn't play with the old Mordekaiser. How was it to play with old Morde? Was he better? Or worse? I'm interested in anything.<|endoftext|>I'm a bronze 1 more main and heres why.

I have mastery 6 on mord as if this posts original date of release I used to play alot of sett and still have more points on him than my mord but I I click better with mord I won 13 ranked games in a row where I didn't carry 2 of the games out if 13! This was huge for me and this is when I made the decision to main mord (in still a little new to the game and I maid the mistake of playing ranked two weeks in of me playing the game) this made my rank awful, in all reality I'm a midsilver potentially low gold Mordecaiser player and I was wondering if anybody had some tips for climbing I'm trying to make it to the silver maybe even gold I'm about to do my promos so whish me luck. Please list any suggestions for playstyle that you guys may have and that'll be all for me and thank you for the potential assistance.<|endoftext|>I’ve been climbing the ranked ladder. Got out of iron last month and I am currently at Bronze 2 needing to win one or two matches in a row to get to bronze 1. I love the feeling of morde top lane and but he for sure has his counter picks like every champion, so I’m wondering for climbing bronze who should I be having as a champion pool? I don’t think morde is the best blind pick, certainly not bad but struggles in certain matchups and then you are just a weak 1v1 if slightly behind and your entire kit revolves on being in the middle of the fight but if you aren’t the scary fed threat that doesn’t go well often. I like mid and top but if jungle or support is where you found success climbing bronze I want to know the secrets or luck in finding that winning recipe. Btw fk everyone who thinks teemo is a good champ, I never have fun laning against him forever stuck unable to touch his turret, and he never has fun because I don’t let the rat touch my turret. I usually end up winning most games vs teemo but man is it boring . Literal wave clear simulator and he’s better at it so it’s just tilting having to wait for the rat to mess up or roam to far so I can gank em.<|endoftext|>All in the title<|endoftext|>Link:  [Mordekaiser Matchups sheet, Patch 11,10 - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15TvitXTUsrAzUEIKpEsLywwgph6X3UlEnEuaO8qR4Vs/edit#gid=0) 

I added the Gwen matchup and an actual guide (work in progress)<|endoftext|>i cant check since i’m out right now, but does anyone know if the vgu effects for lord mordekaiser were released?<|endoftext|>Tired of people winning you the 1vs1 when you are a baby? Take exhaust.

Tired of adc kiting you? Take exhaust.

Tired of losing 2vs1 vs a ranged matchup? Take exhaust.

Of course, this is an exaggeration, but I find exhaust to be really, really good on Morde. You can bait the enemy combo and exhaust them, allowing you to bonk away his souls.

Or maybe someone bought qss for you, what a shame, place them exhaust. They don't panic and use qss? You probably still win the fight, they qss it? Well... Enjoy the trip to Brazil!

I also use it to help my team, exhausting yasuos/Yone that ulted the adc or assasins, allows you to keep your R for that feed Irelia instead of using it to save your adc.

On lane is also good, I'm a mid Mordekaiser player and exhaust allow you to take people inside your realm really easy.

What are your thoughts on this summoner spell?<|endoftext|>I think the most interesting thing about champs like aatrox and mordekaiser is you can kind of head canon your way into believing they are the same person using different bodies everytime they get reworked. Aatrox's sword found a new host when he was reworked and maybe each host has an impact on his particular personality but the overarching goal of constant battle until death and consuming the bodies of the fallen is there in every person who wields aatrox. Mordekaiser on the other hand could use multiple different suits of armors designed for different situations everytime his previous armor is somehow destroyed. The first suit of armor his soul was bound to that we saw was primarily designed very crudely to capture souls and channel his magical powers then he was brought back with a new similar armor designed for capturing large monsters and using them and finally his next suit of armor was designed to make it easier to channel his magic and be more durable and harder to escape. So unlike galio or Warwick who are clearly distinct entities after their reworks mordekaiser and aatrox are still the same people they were pre rework but using different bodies.<|endoftext|>I don't know if thats supposed to happen with Mordekaiser. I was trying my new skin, with a random build to see it (Night Harvester, Rabadon, Void Staff, Na'Shor, Horizon Focus, Magic Pen boots), and it was showing around 50k damage DPS with E Q. Tried inside ult, and it instantly killed the dummy. Is that supposed to happen when its inside your ultimate?

Viego top is (subjective alert) utterly disgusting. I find him to be like a fiora 1v1 scenario. Feels like no matter what I do, unless I give up pretty much all my cs when he is in lane Im gonna die. If Im barely away from my turret, he just walks up to me, w, passive, q, passive and im >40%hp already. Due to his free sustain, poking is useless and you lose all trades. Morde also doesnt have much outplay potential before 6, so theres not much you can do regardless of your skill. If he lands w, youre dead. Especially when they go ignite. Free kill at lvl 2 if you try to cs.  


Yes this is a rant, yes Im tilted, yes I probably need to git gud. But FUCK I hate viego. And the fact that the fuckboy calls himself "king" only makes it even more tilting.<|endoftext|>After i see the W and E animation,can you Still cancel animation with it? Feel like something different about that<|endoftext|>Should I do it. I always enjoyed our Brazilian king and this new skin is tempting me 😩<|endoftext|>For the last 6 years of playing mordekaiser, I've wanted a project mordekaiser skin so badly, and you can only imagine my excitement when I saw that teaser for the new skin, as well as the news of it being a legendary skin. This felt like a very early Christmas for me, and at a first glance it looked pretty much perfect, but the more and more I looked at it... the more the flaws became more apparent to me. 

To start, the visual effects are fucking perfect, except for darkness rise where it looks like I am just glowing very hard at my enemies to deal damage to them, and not shredding or burning them, also took me like 7 matches to finally notice it's suppose to summon rain too... a reoccurring thing for this skin which is very hard to notice. 

The visual design for the colors are very vivid and enjoyable, though he looks a bit too much like an ambulance, especially since the "bug" on his back glows green while the rest of him is red. Aside from that his model and colors are awesome.

His voice and lines are a bit too cheesy or corny for my liking, the default mordekaiser (and by proxy, dark star) have spoiled me a little bit. They need to amp up the synthesizer for his voice or just make him sound deeper and imposing. (this would be fine if this was old mordekaiser, not the new Sauron bootleg we have now).

The animations seem all over the place too and are my biggest gripe, on one hand, you have his walking animation and autos where he is super stiff and robotic (excessively so for his autos) or SUPER animated like with his Q or ctrl+2 where it feels like he is more like kai'sa/ziggs than mordekaiser, which generally removes the proper feeling of weight to the character. His walking is fine, though I would kill if riot would just let us use the walking animation with the mace over his shoulder ON COMMAND, please. His Q needs to have his legs planted on the ground, morde loses all sense of weight if he leaps like super-mario off the ground to wack people, and his turret animation and default autos need some major work, there is a difference from being robotic to just being lifeless/weightless. His ctrl-2 needs a major dial back on the slapstick and stretchiness of his anims, and his legs need to not be so far spread out in the idle for it. His music emote is kind of a major bummer, I was hoping morde would have some overkill performance to blow project pyke out of the water, but instead, we get a rehash of the same thing spirit blossom thresh does for the literal metalhead? And last we have his laugh, the animation is super rad, but the laugh itself is just so lame, they need to take some of default morde's lines and put them through the voice modulator for the rest of his skin.<|endoftext|>So i have some matchups i hate. Those are jax, darius, sett sometimes,  tryndamere and lastly nasus.



I just wanna know how do i play vs a "good jax" I cant do it he just all goes all in uses His E so i cant proc my passive fast enough then if i try to all in its a 50/50 sometimes i win sometimes his W does 350 dmg and i die. Or sometimes he just outlast me with his passive. Really wanna know how to lane vs him :(<|endoftext|>Has someone already tried the new riftmaker? If yes how it feels?<|endoftext|>With Project Mordekaiser coming, which skins would you considered the best?

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/nak1ng)<|endoftext|>For most of the time, people take BP, but in some extended matchups, especially considering your ult + passive, I prefer SW over BP. What do you think? Feels amazing to be that unkillable in lategame (combine it with Gargoyles and Spirit and make your enemies cry).<|endoftext|>I see the interactions video. He want to kill all project form but also threat programs too. The only robot and enemy that he “respect is project: pyke because all we know that pyke is a evolved malware that can’t be destroyed. So who the f create project: mordekaiser?<|endoftext|>Plz<|endoftext|>lord mord recolor is up now<|endoftext|>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ2pwGOjBY4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ2pwGOjBY4)<|endoftext|>it's not a big deal but I feel like Im going to miss spamming my guitar emote on people's corpses when I kill them in brazil.<|endoftext|>So I’m a morde player that happens to play Jax on the side as well, and I saw online that Jax counters Mordekaiser. I just want to ask how exactly Jax counters Mordekaiser? I just feel like Morde has better early and mid game that can really demolish Jax’s late game<|endoftext|>Currently, he's hunched over like a maniac when he's walking (same with regular morde) and it looks kinda dumb. If he walked with good posture, his skin would be so much better.<|endoftext|>I'm Aatrox main and I'm insanely happy for you guys. This skin looks so good. Can't wait to fight against fellow morde mains in that.<|endoftext|>Three gifs. Is project ult at a disadvantage because the light appears sooner? (You have more time to react because you know you are being ulted sooner). I'm not trying to say its pay to lose its more of a question, forgot to add the question-mark in the title.

I play into tanks and they perma cc me and do 10x my dmg, mages out range me and get again do 10x my dmg, darius is aids like always, ranged tops use there micro pp skills to kill me. I just dont understand how they all do all my dmg but everyone else when they play more demolish me when they do exactly the same things I do.. please help.<|endoftext|>A lot of people have noticed that Project Morde's dance is lacking a little oomph in the music department. How cool would it be if it played Pentakill's "The Hex Core?" That way it still has the Project feel but also ties in Mordekaiser's heavy metal influence.<|endoftext|>I'm not sure if this has been suggested before but I legitimately think that Morde would a lot better than his current state if his passive and his w were swapped. It's like a revert with a twist on it where You'd get a shield when damaging enemies that could heal you when you're out of combat and You'd be able to cast his old w on allied champions/minions.<|endoftext|>So I had a lot of success with a build 
Sunfire-demonic-tabis-zonyas-ryalies-random tank item mostly bramble 
But idk if I prefer it over the full ap build what do yall think<|endoftext|>replace his passive with his R’s stat steal ability, happens on every kill now. instead you get the ring of damage when you get to level 6 and it scales with health now. R remains the same, you just get a new passive like jax or sivir. i think this will be interesting because it ads scaling to his R and gives his level 6 power spike more power and meaning against people like gank plank who completely counter it.<|endoftext|>Just to say he was very accurate but he didn't predict the 2 legendaries<|endoftext|>LOOK AT THE VFX ON TWITTER ITS AMAZING<|endoftext|>hey guys i wanted to ask u about sunfire i m really tired of using only riftmaker that s why i want to try sunfire with a hybrid ap and tank build i just want to ask if it is worth building it and does it give a good amount of tankiness i need your opinions<|endoftext|>Keeping this short and simple I used to play Morde to where i got to an m6 and then mained Xayah for a really long time. Im trying to get back into Morde again now and i wanted to know what items/runes to build.

Right now I go Riftmaker--> Armor boots/Merc treads(depending on matchup)-->demonic--> spirit visage/thornmail

Runes i go are: Conq, tenacity, last stand/ Demolish, Revitalize<|endoftext|>I personally think if they want mord to be better they should give this.

W- When shield is still active from this skill gain bonus armor and MR. Just like 10 for each plus 5 percent. 

E- make it like swain e with the root. Would be better for catching enemies since ita so easily dodgeable.

R- Everytime someone is killed in mordekaisers ult give him a permanent 3.5% increase to Ap, armor,MR and health.. Maybe cap at 10 stacks

Tell me if this is too op or needs changes but mord needs buffs compared to most champs or a revert since his old abilities were better.<|endoftext|>Similar to Gwen W where she can build full AP and still get a lot of resistances

AP bruiser items are less tanky than the AD counterparts so this would help Mordekaiser become more tanky without buffing the entire Mage Class<|endoftext|>

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/n9v3eq)<|endoftext|>And should i always go domination secondary with d ring and resolve secindary with d shield?<|endoftext|>Can Morde compete with the other toplaners in this meta?<|endoftext|>I know conq is his bread and butter but is there an instance where u go grasp?

Also is resolve secondary better that domination seconday? Cus i always took ravenous hydra and taste of blood with morde but the shield bash is attractive to me.<|endoftext|>In light of the possibility of a Project Mordekaiser skin, how would he fit into the lore of the Project skin line?<|endoftext|>is it ?<|endoftext|>What is mordekiser build right now? And runes<|endoftext|>so i just saw the new project mordekaiser which was the new legendary skin i got hyped but my question is how much will he cost would like to know for future stuff<|endoftext|>I figured that Spirit Visage would be a really good 3rd item for Mordekaiser, since it's unique passive should boost Morde's durability significantly.

For newer players, Spirit Visage's unique passive is Boundless Vitality, Which increases all healing and shielding received by 25%

But as I browsed more and more Mordekaiser clips, I seemed to notice that many players seemed to prioritize Lich Bane/Nashors Tooth/Cosmic Drive or even Dead Man's Plate more. Are there other reasons other than movement speed and "Haha full AP go BONK"

I don't mind building Visage even against physical damage laners since it's my 3rd item and at that point we're starting to reach late game. Although maybe I'd build armor if they have a fed physical damage bruiser like Riven or Yasuo or something.<|endoftext|>mother of god the time has finnaly fucking com YEEEESSSS<|endoftext|>

https://reddit.com/link/n94c2i/video/8968f92unay61/player<|endoftext|>so over on instagram someone uploaded a rather unorthodox build focusing on autoing the opponent and proc-ing darkness rise rather than having to land q and e  
it seems to be a troll build but i wonder if it would have some viability

so the build has chemtank, nashor's, wit's end, dead man's plate and demonic with berserker's greaves as core items with force of nature, stoneplate and treads or steelcaps as situationals and starting with doran's shield and a health pot leading to bami's and boots

runes are lethal tempo, triumph, tenacity, last stand, eyeball collection and ultimate hunter<|endoftext|>Unless you delay your mythic for a QSS there is a massive window where you cannot walk near him, or be forced to face a stat check champ who just stole your stats. You can't call your jungler, as he kills whichever he wants then turns to the other.

That .5 seconds of cast time leads to all kind of annoying interactions, from bushes breaking LOS stopping ult, other champion abilities breaking Morde ult, and just general lack of power (such as not being able to instantly ult an enemy jungler going for a steal). 

Maybe it's balanced and I'm complaining too much, what do y'all think.<|endoftext|>Since it is "kinda" too late to ask for Old Mord , i had an idea. What if they release a champion that is very similar to Old Mord's kit. They can't really revert the rework , not anymore. If they do revert it , us Old Mord players will be happy , but the New Mord players will be left unpleased. So , that's why i was thinking that,  we should get a champion that is very very close to Old Mord's kit. Having 3 Q's to use , W as an AoE ability that is very similar to Old Mord's one , just without the bugs and that experience share thing. Maybe not the E , because we all know E was a bad ability , it only were used for poke and passive shield. And an Ulti that can turn enemy champion souls into your slaves , at your command. I dunno , of course it will bring a ton of bugs especially with that ult but , they do released Viego. So why not release a champion like this ? I was actually hoping the "next" AP fighter would be like this , but Gwen was far from it. Maybe we will see this design in Isolde , who knows ? Just wanted to share my thoughts with you guys. Would you guys play that champion if it gets ever released ?<|endoftext|>I love morde,we all do,but some times i get bored of him,Ilike morde cuz u need to be in the middle of the enemy team to take advantege of all your abilitis,are there any champs similar to him?<|endoftext|>So i for last tree years iwe been maining Renekton and Jax and i somewhat know their weakneses and strengths. Renekton is early game dominant champion who needs to make lead has great sustain for early game etc etc. Same thing with Jax. Now i want to know Mordekaiser strengths and weakneses and his power spikes so i can know does he fit my playstyle.<|endoftext|>I was on the Mundo subreddit and again someone said that Mordekaiser had no identity and were useless. And he deserved a rework more than Mundo... Even in this subreddit I saw multiple times players asking for a rework. Why would we ask a rework? Before Morde couldn't fit anywhere and his only identity was Lord of Iron... The only thing I miss about the previous Morde was his spells related to classic heavy metal<|endoftext|>I've wondered this ever since I saw this champion get reworked, but why doesn't anything on his R give anything permanent or scale in any way other than cooldown? The amount of stats doesn't scale, the duration doesn't scale, the circle size doesn't scale, nothing. And also, how come when he kills someone in his R does he not get any sort of permanent stat?

In my opinion, he should get like 2% of the stats he stole permanently if he kills someone in his R and could potentially gain size kinda like Cho does. Also the stats stolen should scale like 10%/15%/20% from 6/11/16

What do you guys think? Im in no way a morde main myself, I just dabble in him from time to time top whenever we need ap<|endoftext|>I just ban teemo but i dont think he cpunters morde<|endoftext|>I think i am the only one who misses the Old Mordekaiser's kit and design. I am playing this Mordekaiser a lot and having fun with it but , it makes me bored very quickly unlike the old one. Of course im not saying that he should be reverted , its too late for that and this new one works "kinda" fine. But i really just want a champion like the old one. Not specifically ult but , the idea of your abilities costing HP in exchange for shield stills seems very interesting to me. And tbh old Mord would be countered so much by Serpent's Fang. And three Q bonks , his W's heal saving you at critical moments , it mattered so much to me. I just hope we can get to see something like that in the near future. And having both AD/AP ratios really opened up for diversity , this new Mord really got stuck with items like Riftmaker , Demonic Embrace etc. etc. 


This is not like a complain post , it is just my emotions speaking. Because even when Old Mord actually replaces New Mord , i would be sad because i loved the New Mord aswell. I just hope we can see something like Old Mords mechanics in the near future.<|endoftext|>Background about this game, we were down bad and my mid and bot were losing really hard but the enemy team was full ad except for bard and I knew if we kept playing we could eventually outscale and win and then this gem happened.

Even if he isnt better" than traditional top he is still one of the most fun champs on jungle after the new passive changes. Once you have leeching leer you can just clear for days and never run out of health and you can just walk bot for a free kill with ult. I think his strength in the jungle is not having to immediately deal with counter picks top, an ability to clear so well it's hard to fall behind,  being able to get his core items quickly and challenging/chilling smite both feel like spells that should be in his kit but were taken out to balance him.<|endoftext|>What are viable counters to Morde in the toplane this patch 11.9 for SoloQ ranked?

I know trynd/jax are good counters to Morde but tbh both of them are complete ass rn and they take 30 mins to scale up by then the game is over.

Are there any other good viable counters to Morde that are good throughout the game? I prefer bruisers as tanks rely to heavily on team and if you pick a squishy then your team will never bring a front liner.

I was thinking GP/fiora as well but there both way too reliant on mechanical skill and that is pointless bc when you are focusing on micro play your bot lane will be inting.<|endoftext|>When dying:

If yes i would be extremely suprised, and happy at the same time (btw dont look at my English pls)<|endoftext|>Once upon a time I made a build primer for new players and Morde aficionados to help guide them when deciding what to take on the Iron Revenant, but everything changed when we got to Season 11. 

Now with some more data, people figuring out the items, talking to the community, and my own experimentation, I've got a nice new primer for people to check out. It's a long one, and I'm only talking about bruiser Morde top, not mid or jg nor tank nor full AP Morde. I'll put the TL;DR at the top.

**TL;DR**   

Conq, triumph, alacrity/tenacity, last stand, bone plating/second wind/conditioning, revitalize/unflinching  
AP/AS/AH, AP, AR/MR

Boots -> Riftmaker -> Rylai's/Cosmic Drive -> Zhonya's/Rylai's/whatever -> Visage/whatever -> whatever

* Build bramble early if you need it (try not to)  
* If you do grab bramble don't finish Thornmail until you have to  
* Zhonya's still good, but not always necessary
* Rylai's is almost always amazing  
* Demonic is overrated, but still good in some scenarios, just stop building it blindly every game   
* Nashor's also still good in some scenarios  
* Cosmic Drive underrated, can get it more often  

**TL;DR OVER**  



**Runes**

Conqueror 99% of games. You can experiment with Fleet Footwork (or Phase Rush if you're a mad lad) in rough ranged matchups, or Grasp for rough melee matchups, but most of the time you should just be taking Conqueror. 

Triumph pretty much always. Last Stand also generally the best in the third row. I default to alacrity in the second row, but tenacity is also fine if you need it. 

For secondary trees, you have a lot of options. 
Resolve is great, as you can take pretty much any rune in there except font of life. I go for something in the 2nd and 3rd rows, but what I take depends on matchups and team comps. Conditioning is good for easy lanes, second wind if they're pokey, bone plating if they have no way of proccing it without committing and getting into your bully range. Overgrowth is ok if lane is easy and you want to scale, but it generally doesn't outshine the other two (or even shield bash or demolish for that matter). Revitalize is incredible (especially for rough lanes with second wind), since you get a lot out of your W2. Revitalize boosts the shield size, which boosts the heal amount, which revitalize boosts again. Unflinching is quite good if you need to go steelcaps for lane or are just staring down an unfair amount of CC, otherwise Revitalize is a good generalist rune. 

Sorcery is actually also quite good, especially in the haste build (which we'll get into) - take transcendence and gathering storm in here. 

Domination has seen better days with the ravenous hunter nerfs, and its a lot less relevant with the introduction of leeching leer, but some people still take it. Go for taste of blood and ravenous hunter here. 

For shards, whatever you want in the first row (take haste for the haste build), generally adaptive damage in the 2nd row, and armor or mr in the third row depending on lane matchup. Double attack speed with the shard and alacrity can be redundant, but some people like it. 

**Starting item**

>Doran's Ring  

If you can afford to go it, this is the strongest starting item. A bit of durability, nonzero sustain (mostly the extra potion) and the AP along AND the onhit damage help Morde pull off cheater recalls with a lot more ease to get the boots he really wants. Even in some hard lanes, this item is still great.

>Doran's Shield  

Some lanes, however, require this item. Ranged champions, champions with damage over time effects, or champions that just try to poke you out are all good reasons to take this item over Ring. 

>Dark Seal  

In easy lanes, or games where you know you can snowball and aren't really under threat, this item can be big stonks. As a starter, it's generally inferior to the Doran's items, but if you have extra gold lying around and don't need anything else in particular this is a great item to snag. 

**Mythic**

>Riftmaker  

Riftmaker is the most common and probably the best mythic on Mordekaiser. He loves the vamp, loves extended fights, and appreciates the health and haste. Take this in the vast majority of games. 

>RocketBelt  

Rocketbelt is actually good into matchups or scenarios where you need to get on top of somebody and kill them, especially in death realm. Against many ranged matchups this item can really make you a serious threat, especially with the flat penetration. You'll lack the true damage for sustained fights vs tanky opponents, so be careful. It is a terrifying one-item powerspike, but starts to lose utility as more enemies buy QSS.

>Frostfire

This item has been gaining a lot of popularity, especially in jungle. The reliable slow allows Morde to easily hit abilities, and the extra bulk goes a long way on him. The idea is keep enemies near you and use passive and bami's damage to burn them out. You'll lack damage, but you can get a lot of use out of Demonic in this build. I can't speak for Jungle Morde, but for top Morde this is a situational item to pick up, generally if your team has no bulk to speak of and/or you don't need to worry about your damage to bruisers and tanks. The major downside is that you have to rely on your base damages early, so as a 1-item spike, you'll be weaker than a lot of other champs with their mythic. Thankfully it's cheap and the mythic passive scales quite well. 


Outside of specific defensive components and boots, you should get your mythic first.

**Boots**

Speaking of boots, there are four viable options. You should always buy boots (duh). Morde is slow, and really wants boots two ASAP. At the very least boots one before or IMMEDIATELY after mythic. 

>Plated Steelcaps / Mercury Treads  

I'll lump these together because they occupy the same philosophy (a more defensive boot) but which one you get depends on team compositions. Good in a large majority of situations, whether ahead or not. 

>Ionian Boots of Lucidity  

One of the staples of the haste build. The idea behind the haste build is to just be throwing out so many abilities that the enemy can't keep up. Haste is generally good in extended fights as you get more casts the longer the fight goes, so if Morde can survive to get multiple rotations of his abilities he starts becoming a serious force to be reckoned with. You make up for defense by having shield up more often, you augment your DPS with just constant Qs, you increase your stickiness by using E and R more frequently. The downside of the haste build is its over-reliance on hitting your abilities. You *have* to hit all your Qs to get a DPS increase to stack your shield more for when it's up again, to make up for your sacrifice of resolve and defensive boots. You also lock yourself into animations pretty frequently, which can lead to opponents also hitting more abilities on you.

>Sorcerer's Shoes  

Your other more offensive option, even for bruiser Morde, are the magic penetration boots. Great for stomping early, but not always worth the sacrifice. Be judicious with these. If you want more damage somewhere, these are more reliable than Lucidity.  

**Offense**

2nd (completed) item after mythic, for most situations, should be one of Morde's damage options. It depends on what he wants to do, but damage will help him do what he's good at. Almost all Morde builds have a damage item (often 2+) in them somewhere, not counting mythic. 

>Cosmic Drive  

While this is the other staple of the haste build, it is also really good for standard Mordekaiser as well. As a juggernaut, he is uncharacteristically slow. The extra movespeed can help you get in range for a good R or E, maintain passive, dodge skillshots, you name it. Since it's flat MS, it also scales well with your passive. Not to mention the high haste on this thing helps you dip into the same concepts as the haste build of more frequent abilities converting to more damage and durability in the long run that this item lacks in immediately apparent stats. It's a solid buy in so many situations. It can be picked up whenever into many different builds, but it shines in ones where Morde lives long enough to use the haste. If you're ahead in levels or gold, grabbing this second is quite strong.

>Rylai's Crystal Scepter  

For many situations, especially ones where you're with teammates that can capitalize on this item's slow, Rylai's helps Morde do what he wants a great deal. The idea behind Rylai's is that even though it doesn't offer the extra damage as its contemporaries (aside from the high AP), it is great at both keeping people in your passive and keeping them around to maintain uptime on your passive. This is an outstanding item after mythic in pretty much every build, whether behind or ahead, and in a large majority of situations. Though it does suffer from a bad build path, along with another commonly built item on Morde...

>Demonic Helm  

A lot of people like to build demonic because it looks kind of good on paper, even after all the nerfs. Now, don't get me wrong, there are situations where it is good. If your opponent needs to come into you and they stack a lot of health, or you aren't going a lot of AP and want a bit of extra damage to make up for that, it's great. But a lot of people autopilot into this item when there are other very good options available.

>Nashor's Tooth  

One of those options happens to be this item. Sure, you have less defense with this, but if you're splitting and dueling, Nashor's will get a lot more mileage than Demonic. If you're looking for consistent DPS, this is a fantastic item to grab, though it is generally important to follow it up with defense afterward.

**Defense**

If you're going to grab a component early delaying your mythic or second damage item, it should probably be for a defensive item later on. Defensive items can be picked up whenever, but completing them is often saved for later, usually 3rd or even 4th item. If games go late enough to get to 5 items defensive options are mostly going to be what Morde looks at, assuming he doesn't have a few already. Most builds will have at least one defensive option by 3rd item, or at least a component of one if a game ended before that stage was reached. 

>Seeker's Armguard, Stopwatch and Zhonya's Hourglass  

Seeker's did go from being literally the best item in the game to being just OK, but for Morde that can be good enough. Not having to sacrifice AP for some good armor is a pretty compelling argument for seeker's. Stopwatch as an early pickup can be an incredibly versatile item, either saving your skin or winning a close fight with a fadeaway passive burn, or by making a dive free. Likewise, Zhonya's has lots of good uses, but it's not exactly a pure defensive item, and won't always be enough.

>Spectre's Cowl and Spirit Visage  

Though it has fallen from grace from the premier tank MR option it once was, on Morde Visage is huge stonks because of its interaction with W. The item has a ton of health on it, which your shield scales off of, it boosts the power of said shield, and then if you want to heal it's even better. Coupled with your healing from conq or riftmaker, and not to mention the haste as a cherry on top, this item puts in a ton of work. If you need MR, get this item. Spectre's Cowl is still a nice pickup in some lanes (a few annoying Yordles come to mind), but the existence of leeching leer has kind of made it unnecessary. 

>Bramble Vest (and its weird older brother)  

Should need no introduction, if you asked me what the most common first back buy was on the majority of top laners, my answer would be this thing. It's an outstanding component to sit on. Were it not for all the healing and autoattackers in top lane this would be a situational item. In certain matchups it provides the extra damage you need to win, though not from the thorns, but from the health certain champions just didn't get to heal because of the grievous wounds. Unfortunately its older brother Thornmail is not as cool as the vest. Especially because of the lack of reliability in getting that bonus grievous, the item is usually not worth finishing until you need the space. You pay a lot for just the extra grievous, and while it can be a big difference maker, the gold you have is better spent on other stuff. 

EDIT: Patch 11.11 - with the nerfs to bramble, this is more of a situational pickup now vs healers specifically. It is not ubiquitously good against everything AD, but with the amount of healing in the game it's still a decent component to pick up. Oblivion Orb is a viable alternative that should also be considered.

>Warden's Mail and Randuin's Omen  

Because healing is so common this item is generally considered less often than thornmail, but if you actually just want the raw defense this is your best one stop shop for armor. Warden's Mail is underrated as a component. A lot of people meme about the passive being useless but it ends up being worth quite a bit of damage reduction in the long run. It works on minions, monsters, and tower shots. It's hard to argue picking it up as an early component because seeker's and bramble (and steelcaps) exist, but Randuin's is really quite good. You don't have to only pick it up against like 2+ crit champions, since it reduces AD it works against AD casters just as well. If you need more armor beyond Thornmail and Zhonya's, this is also fine since Dead Man's plate got murdered in cold blood.

EDIT: Patch 11.11 This item and its component got significantly better with the buffs. In situations you're getting slapped by autoattackers like Jax this item is huge. Moving to primary defensive options.

**Situational / Honorable Mentions**

Some items are really only worth picking up in specific situations or only work in combination with certain builds. Still, I think they're worth mentioning.

>Morellonomicon  

Sometimes you need grievous wounds but need to be proactive with them, or bramble isn't terribly effective at stopping healing or has its armor wasted (Vlad, Fiddle, Swain, Zac and Sylas come to mind). Ideally your team builds grievous wounds for these situations, but it's not always that simple. Grab oblivion orb for a bit if you need to before Riftmaker and finish Morello later. 

>Gargoyle Stoneplate  

This item really only works if you have other defensive items backing it up. It's like the Infinity Edge or Rabadon's of tank items. It's not a one-item solution for tank stats like it was last season. Still, in the builds it's good in, it's REALLY good. If you need to be the frontline or tanky for whatever reason, this item is amazing as a late game grab. Very good in the Full Tank Morde build.

>Void Staff  

Against MR stacking teams you need to get through this is a fantastic item, outside that it's not worth buying because of Morde's innate magic penetration. If your team completely bungled draft and you have like 4+ AP champs against some tanks you might have bigger problems, but if you're ahead and they're building MR to stop the carnage this can help you keep up.

>Force of Nature  

Only worth picking up if you already have visage, or you're just getting hard slapped by some spell spammer. Still, if you need to stack MR its the next best. Do your best to avoid building Abyssal Mask, that item is better built by your frontline initiation. You use the Movespeed from Force of Nature so much better. 

>Banshee's Veil  

Should be self explanatory. If you really need to dodge a specific spell or you lose, this item solves that problem. Not worth buying for the MR when Visage exists.

>Lich Bane  

Not totally troll in bruiser builds, it gives you somewhat more reliable damage with the movement speed and bonus auto damage that can make use of Morde's high base AD. If you're only getting to auto every so often and will have a hard time hitting abilities, this item can give you a bit more reliability. There's also something to be said for it's tower taking power. It can be a substitute for Nashor's in some cases. I'm not a huge fan, but others seem to like it.

>Mejai's  

Dark Seal is a good early pickup, and if the game is going well and you think you can stack it effectively without dying, Mejai's is a fine item even in bruiser builds. Similar to Sorc shoes however, be judicious with your use of this item. 

>Rabadon's  

Can be grabbed in bruiser builds from time to time, but generally you have other things you need. If you just want raw unfiltered damage on Q to just sting harder, it technically does the most for it. 

>Abyssal Mask

The damage amp on this thing is no joke, but only when your team can capitalize on your pulls. If you're not immediately R'ing whoever you pull and playing more frontline with your team, this item can be strong, but the 20 extra MR does not make up for Visage's extra tankiness through its passive, or the movespeed from FoN when you need to be shmoovin. 

>Warmong's Armor

If you don't have Riftmaker or Ravenous Hunter for sidelane sustain, this item can help you stay on the map. Generally better in tankier builds provided you have the resists to actually use the absurd HP on this thing. Your W gets downright absurd with this item. Usually seen in the full tank or Frostfire variants. Gets most of its value when you're taking short skirmishes or need to endure vs poke damage. 

>Other mythics  

Sunfire Morde can come in when your team lacks frontline as an alternative to Frostfire. You'd pick it up instead of frostfire if you need to be tanky but also deal damage for extended fights, and your enemies lack mobility. It's usually reserved for full tank morde, which isn't very popular. There might be a world where Chemtank is an answer, but if your team's draft was so bad that you need Chemtank Morde to do anything, you've got bigger problems. Stick to Frostfire into Demonic Embrace if you want to go a tankier but still bruiser style. I will not indulge the Moonstone build, because only one person needs to buy grevious and/or serpent's fang and the build falls apart. Liandries wastes too much on the mana for what it sacrifices in defenses, and I have yet to see Everfrost work. Ludens and Sunderer are probably reportable. 

RocketBelt will be better than Harvester in the vast majority of situations you'd want to build Harvester. Even for full AP meme builds. 

And that's it. Hopefully you have a better idea of what to build, when, and why, or things you might want to try out.<|endoftext|>hi i was wondering when should i buy night harvester as a first item? in what matchups exactly/what situation(s)?

Does it feels good?<|endoftext|>Hey peeps!

I don't see a ton of information about Morde jungle on the various sites, so I figured I'd throw in my two cents here. I'm low ELO, but been playing casually since S1.

**Runes**

I've been having good success with Conqueror still, but mostly for the late game. I don't have a lot of protracted fights early on so I could definitely see some benefit for other runes, especially in the Domination tree (they could all be decent tbh) or even the Sorcery tree (at least until they nerf Phase Rush.) 

For secondary, honestly, I think there's so many good choices that I don't have a strong feeling except to say that I like buying boots first back, so I don't particularly like Inspiration. I'm going with Sorcery for Transcendence and Nimbus Cloak, because the decrease in cooldowns is tremendous. I could also see going Waterwalking to help with ganks if you're coming from the river, but I need the CD and move speed because my aim with Q and E is garbage. 

**Items**

I find that since we don't have to fight for a lane that Riftmaker isn't quite as good on Jungle Morde. It's still a great item, and a safe buy, but I've also really liked Night Harvester. For ganks, hitting the first ability and then getting the move speed from it makes ganks feel a lot smoother. In late game, especially if you choose to build more tanky to complement your team, I think Riftmaker is still the best.

I personally like Night Harvester -> Cosmic -> Nashor -> Zhonya's for my AP build. For the tankier build, I prefer Riftmaker -> Rylai's -> Zhonya's -> Tank Items. The slow helps my team more than the move speed from Nashor. Since it's controversial (or so it seems?) I do build Demonic Embrace as a 5th or 6th item for the tankier build, since my main goal is just to stay alive in the middle of the fight dealing Q and AoE damage. I don't really use it for the AP build at all.

I've also seen folks using Rocketbelt, but I'm old and have enough trouble hitting Q and E to worry about getting an aimed item cooldown in there as well (even if it is super easy to hit.) Your mileage may vary.

For boots, go with what you need. My default is Sorc Shoes, but if I'm going tankier I'll build Tabi/ Merc. I haven't tried Lucidity, but I expect it's also a good default choice.

**Jungling**

Can't recommend Phylaris enough. Doubtful, too. Here's the link for Phylaris Morde jungle clear, which is a full clear at scuttle around 3:13: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0ZJ50vdIMM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0ZJ50vdIMM)

Morde clears like crazy, and the main goal is to hit everything with Q and E when possible, and keep your passive up between camps (especially the solo camps. Not as big a deal on birds or wolves, since one Q will bring it back up.) You can full clear and get to scuttle pretty fast even without a leash. Red start seems ideal, and honestly you don't lose a ton of time without a leash, so if Top won't leash you, you can be okay. Especially since a lot of the time that means you're going to an uncontested crab (especially in lower ranks.)

I recommend the same as Phylaris does in his video for abilities: Q -> E -> W. Keeps you healthier in the second half and doesn't cost you a ton of time. Q -> E -> Q is faster, but if they invade or fight at crab you're gonna be real low.

I've tried Red Smite and Blue Smite, and I think both have uses. Choose depending on the enemy team comp, and how good you are at hitting Es and Qs. Blue smite is great if you have any trouble hitting a runner, whereas Red smite helps if you have to take a hard fight into someone who'll turn around and fight back.

Morde can take Dragons and Rift pretty reasonably. Not the fastest, not the slowest, but his passive ensures you're dealing constant damage which is great. Once you have R, you can gank lanes aggressively -- but I recommend ganking bot lane. They're lower level, and since you can take one out of the fight, your bot can usually clean up the other while you're in the Death Realm. Here's where I really like Blue Smite, Night Harvester, and Nimbus Cloak. Your ganks are fast, and your abilities are easy to hit.

Anyways, that's my take. Hope it helps some folks, and/ or sparks some discussion. Morde jungle is strong as hell right now imho.<|endoftext|>:))))))))))))<|endoftext|>Pentakill Mordekaiser is his worst skin. Now this is my opinion so take it with a grain of salt. I started playing mordekaiser cose of his design (I love knights) and was happy that all of his skins also looked very cool. Then I saw pentakill and I rly can't see why everyone loves it the design just isn't that great. It's the only morde skin I don't own. Now why am I even talking about this? Im preety sure the next mordekaiser skin will be a new Pentakill one (like they did for kda) so im hoping they will improve on it.<|endoftext|>He definitely gets a benefit from the shorter lane since he can retreat quicker, and he would easily bully these squishy midlane mages and assassins, so why isn’t he in mid more often?<|endoftext|>Originally, I just wanted to ask about spirit visage vs rylai's as the final item, but after reading the subreddit a bit there were a ton of new questions that popped into my head.

This is the build I am currently using, pulled from the highest pickrate item in lolalytics

Riftmaker -> Demonic -> Zhonya -> Thornmail -> Rylai's

I saw a bunch of posts about how people though demonic was bad but I'm not really sure if I agree. The burn is like 5% hp over 4 secs and I think it might reset the timer on new damage, although I'm not too sure. and 10-20 armor/mr when fighting.

Also the pickrate is at 28% for demonic and 3% for cosmic drive 4% for rylai's and 11% for nashor's which are all the most common picks for a second item. Generally, people would gravitate towards the optimal item selection which is why I base by builds around that.

These are my thought processes for the alternative items. Cosmic seems like the best replacement as it is a very big stat stick but it is much less tanky than demonic. Rylai's I'm not sure about the value of the slow, if it really is all that important. As for nashor's I think most of morde's damage come from his Q and passive and the autos are just there for stacking and when q is on cooldown. It just sacrifices hp which I think is a little bit more important for bruisers.

I think Zhonya's is a no brainer for the 3rd item as it honestly is the most powerful item in the game IMO. I just like to generally build it as a third item in most cases after my 2 core damage items are completed.

Also, is spirit visage worth it over rylai's as a final item just for the 25% shield boost? I found that in the majority of games there are only 1 or 2 ap champs which means MR is not super valuable. If there are a bunch of AP champs usually I would replace thornmail with spirit visage, but I am just talking about the much more common AD focused teams that I encounter.

Anyways, if you guys could explain the optimal item selection for the 2nd and last items it would be greatly appreciated!<|endoftext|>Hi! Tedfromsales here!

I have recently been looking for ways to spice up the morde meta and I think I may have stumbled onto either a new or current second tree. INSPIRATION. In my opinion morde is a mid to late game sometimes early bruiser that uses items too their full extent. Because morde can use items like riftmaker and rylais so well it can cause some games to feel like you are just waiting to get you items before you can be useful to the team rather than just you lane. 

after the nerfs on ravenous hunter I began looking for different rune setups but keeping the core the save ie. conq, triumph, legend, and last stand, but recently i used to inspiration tree and had some very interesting results.

I took futures market and magical footwear and these two thing sped up my early game and help compensate for some accidental deaths. Magical footwear give a deceptively large amount of ms to help Cathryn up to your prey in not only normal fight but also in your ult preventing kiting and such (even without cosmic drive or rylais) the only con is that if you don't kill or trade in lane you might not be able to get those resistant boots for you lane mate as soon as you'd like. As for futures market, it drastically helps you obtain those certain item powerstpikes as component items like bramble and leeching leer can catapult you stance in lane. not to mention the almost guaranteed control wards to help with pre-6 ganks as mordekaiser tends to play passive without vision. 

Anyway I'd love to here your guys opinion on this either by testing it or just giving me your thoughts. of course this is somewhat situational, like revitalize and bone plating are very good for bursty top laners, but for a mathcup where there is no clear advantage this might be one of the new best options. Heres a game of mine.

So why are people so clinging on building it 1st on Mordekaiser over Demonic Embrace?



Demonic Embrace gives you more defensive stats:   
\+50 HP from stats,   
\+10 (up to 20) MR and Armor from passive,  
and DoT passive that synergizes with his passive.
\-200 gold cheaper

Riftmaker gives you:  
\+8% Omnivamp, but the stat isn't so strong early as you lack the damage to utilize the vamp,  
same goes for Item passive,   
\+15 Ability Haste, which may be useful on Mordekaiser, but that won't make much difference as the most of your damage still comes from the passive.   
\+10 AP may be relevant, but AP isn't reason he builds it - see people building tank on Mordekaiser.



I am not a Mordekaiser main by no means, but I am so confused. Why is this a thing?

At this point I would buy a Zhonya if I didn’t already

I mostly never get full build but if I do it’s some form of CDR to last longer in team fights with W.

Where could I fit a demonic in this?<|endoftext|>Since everyone can share their thoughts about a mini rework here, I thought I might try my hand at it too. Little disclaimer: I am not a native English speaker, so have some mercy.
Basically, I'm happy with the "now-not-quite-so-new" Mordekaiser. Aesthetically at least, it's certainly one of the best reworks so far, even if there were some obvious cutbacks (VFX). The Q has the same charm as before the juggernaut update, the E is also passable. The overall concept is perfectly okay, even if it is definitely not flawless and in my opinion lacks a certain "link" both to the "Master of Metal" and within the abilities themselves.
For one thing, Mordekaiser pre-rework was a champion who really had to work with his shield as a resource for long stretches fights and thus calculate his sustain. Nowadays it's used in a much more one-demensional way: Healing or time game for 4 seconds.
Furthermore, there is the missing AD-utilization. Why don't you give a champion who can steal various stats a tool to use all of it properly. I understand that they wanted to push him hard in the AP-juggernaut line, but there are better ways to do so. Just adding said AD-utilization would give the players so many more itemization options for meaningful as well as "interesting" niche builds. And build-diversity is never a bad thing, isnt it?
But before I stalking myself into a frenzy, I'll just get started. It is a bit wall-of-text-like, but I'll try to keep it short. Sorry about that: 


(P) Darkness Rise
Innate: Mordekaiser's basic attacks deal 40% AP bonus magic damage on-hit.
Damaging basic attacks and basic abilities grant Mordekaiser a stack for 4 seconds for every enemy champion or monster hit, stacking up to 4 times. At 4 stacks, Mordekaiser gains "Darkness Rise". Subsequent damaging attacks and basic abilities against enemy champions and monsters refresh the duration.
Darkness Rise: Mordekaiser deals 5 − 15.2 (based on level) (+ 30% AP) (+ 2% (+ 1 / 2 / 3% per point on his ultimate ability) of target's maximum health) magic damage per second to all nearby enemies and gains 3% bonus movement speed. The damage against monsters is capped at 180.
On the whole, I think his passive is in a good spot. The small change in percentage damage is more to give his ultimate a bigger impact. Sure - it's neither " Creeping Death" nor "Harvest of Sorrow", but with an interaction between his passive and "(W) Indestructible" at least old mains could get a nostalgic feeling. But more on that later. Since an isolated "Q Obliberate" triggers the innate on-hit effect (and should therefore generate 2 stacks), the number of required stacks is increased to 4.


(Q) Obliberate
Active: Mordekaiser smashes the area in the target direction, dealing magic damage to all enemies within, increased if it hits only one enemy and also applied on-hit and on-attack effects at 100% effectivness.
AOE Damage:
	100% Base AD (+ 60 % Bonus AD) (+ 40 / 55 / 70 / 85 / 100 ) (+ 50% AP)
Damage increase:
	(10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 %)

As already written, one of the major design flaws is that Mordekaiser can't really use some of the stats stolen by his ultimate (AD). To fix this and to give more diversity to his builds, at least one AD-utilization should be found in his abilities - "(Q) Obliberate" is best suited for this. Since an isolated Q also triggers his passive on-hit, the ability still scales better with AP. Regardless of his passive, triggering on-hit and on-attack effects makes a lot of sense from my point of view for this ability. We are hitting someone with a giant mace right on the head (if not then, when should such effects be triggered?). The waveclear is weaker in the middle and later game due to the lower base damage. It takes 668 AP(with Nashor's 325 AP) at level 18 to get to the same isolated damage values. The damage loss with somewhat more realistic values of 300-400 AP is between 70 and 50 damage - hurts but is quite acceptable. A full AP build is still capable to does disgusting isolated damage (Sweet Sheen Music), but the lack of tankyness would make him such a vulnerable glass cannon that it would hardly be worth the risk. 


(W) Indestructible
Passive: Mordekaiser stores 35% of the post-mitigation damage he deals and 15% of the pre-mitigation damage he takes, reduced by 75% for non-champion sources, as potential shield on his secondary resource bar, up to 100 + 10% base health + 30 / 32,5 / 35 / 37,5 / 40% of his bonus health. The potential Shield decays by 8 − 25 (based on level) every second after not dealing or taking any damage for over 1 second, down to a minimum of 5% of his maximum health.
Active: Mordekaiser consumes all his current potential shield to himself and gains 10 (+ 1 per 10 AP ) armour and MR. In combat, the shield remains stable until it is destroyed. After 3 seconds out of combat, the shield will be absorbed and heals Mordekaiser for 40 / 42,5 / 45 / 47,5 / 50 % of its remaining value
Passive - Wheel of drain: While "(W) Indestructible" is activated, Mordekaiser regenerates his shield for each enemy champion, enemy unit or neutral monster who take damage from "Darkness Rise".
Shield per second from enemy units and monsters: 
	1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 per point on "(W) Indestructible"
Shield per second from each enemy Champions:
	1,0% of Mordekaisers maximum shield 

I'm trying to kill two birds with one stone with this changes. On the one hand, AP heavy builds should have a small but powerful shield at their disposal, while juggernaut-, off- or even full-tanks-builds are equipped for longer fights. This is ensured by the AP-dependent bonus resistances (For the record: The thought of bonus resistances depending on AP was in my mind before the Gwen leak / release - I seem to be slow), the better scaling with bonus health later in the game and the new passive "Wheel of drain". The admittedly blunt interaction between the latter and "Darknes Rise" could give Mordekaiser's game more depth and demand decisions from the player which go beyond timing the (re-)activation of the ability. Personally, I would be happy to see a touch of "always shield - never die", especially if it is designed more fairly than pre-rework. I do not to say whether this idea is the right way to go about it. What possibilities would you see without completely redesigning or swapping skills?


(E) Death´s Grasp

Cutting a long story short - in my opinion, the ability is perfectly fine.


(R) Realm of Death
Active: Mordekaiser slows the target enemy champion by 75% during the cast time, after which they're banished together with Mordekaiser to the Death Realm for 6 / 6,5 / 7 seconds. Mordekaisers gains 0 / 1 / 2 stacks for "Darkness Rise".
Units between realms see each other as spirits, considering each other dead and negating any interactions between the two. Only the target and Mordekaiser will enter the realm; other champions cannot follow them. Everything that occurs inside the Death Realm is hidden, and all pets still inside are killed at the end.
Additionally, for the same duration, Mordekaiser consumes the target's soul, reducing their current AD, AP, total AS, maximum health, armor, magic resist, and size by 10%, in addition to gaining them for himself. If the target dies while inside, Mordekaiser keeps their partial stats until they respawn and permanently retains 10 / 15 / 20 % of these. If the target kills Mordekaiser within the "Realm of Death", it receives double the stolen values back until Mordekaiser respawns.
If one of the two affected champions leave the Death Realm, because of having died or having it dispelled, the other will do so as well, but the stats will remain stolen for the full duration.
"Darkness Rise" deals 1% per point on his ultimate ability of target's maximum health additional damage.

The duration of "Realm of Death" is slightly shortened on early levels, but grants additional stacks for "Darkness Rise" later on. In addition, you are able to receive permanent bonus stats amounting to 1-2% of the maximum stats of the target at the time of their dead if it dies within the Death Realm. The permanent gain of stats by killing enemies should reward players for a good use of the ultimate. The gain is deliberately kept very low, especially in early game, and should only really be noticeable in late game - unless killing Veigars is your hobby. Nonetheless, it's probably debatable gamedesignwise - lorewise, it suits him very well and could serve as compensation for the lost damage and the weaker shield. To give the opponent a reason to fight against him within the ultimate, the enemy is promised 10% additional stats until Mordekaiser respawns. This means that the player has to choose his target for the ultimate even more carefully - taking the fed carry out of the fight for 7 seconds is no longer automatically the optimal choice.


TLDR+Maths:
- AD Scaling on Q
- Stable shield in combat, possibility to maintain and to replenish it through "Darkness Rise"
- Permamentous collecting of stacks in deplorable height duo to sending foes to Brazil

Thank you for reading, I would be happy to hear one or two other opinions.<|endoftext|>Just like the title says. I am exited for that new recolor, but it takes so long for it to actually come on pbe. If someone knows when is it coming on pbe/live, please tell me.

I'm an old Morde main Im at 800K from before the rework and was wondering if anyone had some general tips and advice for Morde as of this season, any favorite builds? I use to go liandrys rylais<|endoftext|>I am struggling so much with good usage of R. Both in and out of lane. Do you guys have any general rules of thumb you use to make sure your R is effective? I'm not using it to get kills in lane usually, only when I'm threatened by junglers or to turn a fight after my enemy commits and I would lose without it.Should I just instantly hit R sort of like how Darius uses pull, as soon as they want to stop fighting I go 'nonono, we're not done here' and murderize them? Combo with E even when they haven't used their CC or mobility yet? 

In teamfights I almost always use it poorly and lose the fight because my ult was bad. I tend to stand in front and never really look for flanks, maybe flanking is something I need to be better at on Morde, but I generally just ult the other frontliner and then die when I come out. Or I ult the diver/assassin, when my team was ready to kill them anyway and I end up saving the diver and my team wastes abilities and then get engaged on. 

Any good ult habits I can just try to practice to get the hang of them?<|endoftext|>I checked some morde guides. They all were recommending %10 as shard. Can someone explain?<|endoftext|>or is it too squishy for morde?<|endoftext|>Mine is initiating a teamfight by ulting someone I managed to pull out of position with my E, killing them or not but then standing there all on my own after the ult, surrounded by the enemy team and my own team is just a whole screen away watching me get mauled in a second.<|endoftext|>Bro is there anyway to beat nasus? I’m literally diamond 2, and in my experience Nasus/Irelia are THE worst matchups.

PS: there's no good Mordekaiser guides on YouTube, just a bunch of streamers putting their Morde gameplay in yt.<|endoftext|>I got tired of having a full passive bar but not having W's cooldown up and have started maxing W second... and it feels surprisingly good. A big problem of maxing E second is that you'll rarely get 2 casts of W in fights. W Max second has saved my butt a couple of times now.

Give it a shot and see how it feels. I generally go NH/Protobelt into Cosmic for more movement speed and CDR.<|endoftext|>I know that stridebreaker doesn’t give great stats for morde but the active is way too good. Wouldn’t morde benefit greatly from it because of his lack of mobility? Would love to hear y’alls thoughts<|endoftext|>

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/mxjqtd)<|endoftext|>So I've had a thought. Or a few. Why not add passive bonus to ultimate, say each level you get 10% bonus to all your stats, and increse in size, by ?(5?)%  So each ultimate level would have some significant boost to your already poor stats an he would scale better in to the late game. Also would be pretty neat if you would convert AD in to AP (or adaptive if you feel like going crazy build), like Sylas does. 

And of course I still think it's bonkers that QSS removes your ult, when even the devs in their champion rework video said, they are giving people a chance to fight, hence the pretty big area. (and in the end of the video, bearded guy said, nothing can save you from Mordekaiser)  Well even if  devs want to keep QSS viable against him, at least make it so champion abilities wouldn't cleanse it. Once youre in, youre in. If enemy was CC immune during cast, fine, but when not, that's it, you stay here.

Another though is why Mordekaisers Q is so slow... it's his primary damage source. It is too slow, that is said by both big streamers (yes even Tyler1 said that it's so slow, and he even complained why it's not instant) and just top (masters-challengers level top laners) players, like KaizerMorde, Anubis, Smurf (GM and pro player EUW), Teamless (Master EUW) say his abilities are far too slow, especially his Q. In my humble opinion, instant would be really op considering it's range, but cast time decrease really, really welcomed.

Now E.. well i'm pretty fine with it's speed, but would like a litle bit of widht added, but mostly I'm all for cd reduction. IMO start with 20 or each level would give 4 seconds decrease instead of 3. 

As for W, will it be given a rework or not as it currently stands, and is maxed last, simple cooldown reduction would really mean a lot. 

So that;s about it.<|endoftext|>

Rylai's -> Boots -> Gargoyle -> Frostfire -> Thornmail/Spirits -> Demonic embrace/Cosmic drive

I like getting Rylais since it acts as a perma slow inside your passive. Gargoyle is simply a strong tank item, and popping it while your W is on cooldown really comes in clutch. Getting Frostfire before gargoyles is optional if you want to melt camps/objectives faster. 

Frostfire imo offers more utility versus Riftmaker. In games where everyone loves getting GW, the omnivamp really becomes minor, whereas frostfire offers even more aoe slows, good tank and health stats (the bonus health from mythic passive). Currently, the aura passive deals 150% to jungle monsters (sunfire is also going to get this next patch, but i simply prefer frostfire over it). 

The rest of the build is straightforward itemization versus the enemy comp, whether they have more ad or ap, if they have lots of healing; if I movement speed to catch up, or if I need max health % damage. 

For runes, it'd conqueror. Secondary runes should be revolve -> revitalize + conditioning

Getting fed with this build is easy, as no one suspects the big slow after rylai's. Ganking requires more effort, where you're forced to path behind the enemy laner before going in. I save E knowing that they have a flash ready. Make sure to run ghost. 

This build was made to solve mordekaiser's big issue with getting kited, while being a complete raid boss. You'll still deal tons of damage. What do you think? What would you change about the build?<|endoftext|>Everytime i fight nasus, the enemy jungler camps me all game, and nasus ends up 9/0, and the only help i get from my team is a "GL" from my jungler in champ select.

[ty riot, i want my lp back](https://reddit.com/link/mxa31x/video/a2w2gu4xz0v61/player)<|endoftext|>Hey y’all! Was looking for some advice on this matchup. 

My guess is it’s make or break on the first 4 waves? I built a slow push, bullying Nasus hard at every chance. When the wave bounced, my mind blanked for a second and I messed up the freeze (Q’d the wave). I was never able to freeze it again. I was up 2-3 plates and 20 CS when we hit level 10, but he rushed QSS and stacked under turret. He won the first all in at lvl 10. I believe he had around 200-250 stacks. I did my best to poke him constantly, but I was never able to get him in kill range when his jungler wasn’t there. From there, I’m aware that he definitely outscales me, so I never fought him 1v1 again.

My team wound up winning the game, with Nasus and I both being extremely strong(we farmed better than everyone else), but it was on a coin flip elder fight. I felt hugely impactful, but I was frustrated that I didn’t understand how I could beat this dog consistently. 

Any advice on how to deal with Nasus earlier? (A good one that tries not to let you freeze, and specifically when they rush QSS first item) Is freezing 100% necessary? Do you dive with your jungler? Thanks for help!<|endoftext|>Most people and guides says that conq is best but I feel like it’s a bit weak, it’s either that or i’m just not that good at proccing it.

It was essentially some water themed Mordekaiser that I thought worked perfectly. Morde was basically just covered in sea shells, coral, sea weed etc. anything to make him look like he just came from the depths of the ocean.  


I thought his abilities were really flexible in terms of fitting with other types of skins. His passive could just simple, just replace it with water, or even add fish and small waves if you want.   


His Q could just make a splash  and maybe leave a sand mark on the ground similar to Dark Star Mordekaiser just fracturing space.   
His W can give him a brighter look, as if he were covered in hardened shells.  


His E can easily fit the form of a wave pushing the enemies towards him.  


Lastly and most definitely not least, his ultimate can just be an arena in the water. The background could just be filled with some sea creatures, references to H.P. Lovecrafts stories underwater, or even easter eggs of other champions and their skins like Pyke, Crabgot, Nautilus etc.<|endoftext|>For context Mordekaiser is an OVA mecha anime of Mazinger.

The good thing is both items complete with a blasting wand...so depend on match.up or teams u could choose to finisher either nashor or riftmaker first...giving some nice flexibility. What do u guys think? Guess this can work on top morde too<|endoftext|>Hello, not tilted or anything just recently had a game where a Morde on my team was literally 1v5ing every fight, my entire team was running it down and he was soaking 5 peoples spells while killing them all at once, (d4 elo). Not only this game but others I've seen how insanely strong he is and the amount of reduced damage he takes with just Leer, I looked him up online and he hasn't been nerfed since like patch 9.15 only buffs. Do you mains think he's overtuned? IMO He I think his ult should be a bit less oppressively, no matter how ahead you really can't beat him.<|endoftext|>If QSS/self cleanses can't remove the banishment part of Morde's ult. I mean, if the enemy recovers their stats, okay fine. But a flimsy piece of cloth/an orange/a roar/ angry Viking, etc flat-out nullifying Morde's biggest ability is super silly.<|endoftext|>his build path is very confusing to  me after riftmaker so i'd really appreciate some advice<|endoftext|>So I've seen morde runes taking double adaptive force, and I've seen them taking one attack speed and one adaptive force, and I always wondered which gave him better raw DPS. So I decided I'd do a (decidedly not thorough) test and see which is better!

Each trial was done over 10 seconds of attacking, with timing starting at first auto which is immediately followed by a Q E. I then would cancel the next auto possible once Q came off of cooldown.

1 Attack speed/1 adaptive force

Level 3: 120dps

Level 9 (riftmaker): 325dps

Level 18 (riftmaker zhonyas demonic): 600dps


2 Adaptive force

Level 3: 116 dps

Level 9 (riftmaker): 320dps

Level 18 (riftmaker zhonyas demonic): 630dps

TL;DR/Conclusions:

The differences between the two rune setups are negligible and could easily be explained by my shoddy testing methods. For all intents and purposes, Double adaptive and 1 attack speed/1 adaptive put out the same DPS, and scale the same with items and levels. Attack speed makes Mordekaiser able to farm in early laning much better, so take that.<|endoftext|>Stop<|endoftext|>Why is this animation idle only? Is it intented or just laziness of riot?

I haven’t played him jungle yet but I have a 71% morde winrate top.<|endoftext|>Any combination of these reworks would be appreciated.

Main idea: Swap Passive and W around.

Passive: Old Shield Passive. Mordekaiser shields himself for 10/20/30% (scaling with Ult rank) of his damage dealt (halved against minions)

W: Active. Gain Darkness Rise, dealing AoE damage around him for 4 seconds. Hitting an ability or basic attack extends this duration by 2 seconds. Morde can recast this ability to drain the lifeforce of his enemies, healing for a flat amount per unit (reduced on minions) up to a cap (similar to Renekton Q).

This would bring back Morde as an offensive focussed juggernaut that needs to be constantly fighting to survive but isn’t completely gimped of his damage if he misses Q and E.


Other ideas because for fun:

Q: Tap Q: Regular Q stuff, bonks in front of him.

Hold Q: Similar to Sion Q, charge up a devastating Bonk with big damage and applies a slow, both scaling with charge time.


R: Channels a curse on targeted enemy for 1.5s that slows for 75%. If channel fully completes, Morde does normal R stuff. The difference is that you cannot QSS or free yourself once inside the ult but you can QSS the channel. Stops people from gimping Morde with a 1300 gold item.

Another R idea: Same shit as normal but the whole arena applies a DoT (scaling with enemy Max HP and Morde AP) and drains the enemies stats over time rather than stealing. Would mean his R is more than just a pseudo utility tool and more strictly offensive. Meant to be similar to old Morde R but with current Morde R.


Naturally, none of the numbers or combinations of these ideas are balanced and other changes would need to be made. Just trying to give some flair to his current abilities and reviving some of the old Morde feeling.<|endoftext|>I don’t know if it’s because I’m filthy bronze thrash but I have a really hard time doing wave management as Mordekaiser.

You'll find this post is perhaps not the usual post you'd see here. It usually is a meme build, an outplay or a meme about Brazil. Sometimes, maybe even a rework hint. However, this is not one of those posts.

I am writing this post to share with you how much Mordekaiser has helped me with my mental health. This is the first time that I am noticing how much impact Sahn Uzal has helped me cope with many of the common problems in my life. First and foremost, I must say that my issues are very small in comparison to what other people that I have known have gone through. If you need to talk to someone about bigger problems, such as depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, and other problems you may be suffering from, please, ask for help. 

Recently, particularly yesterday and around one month ago, I broke up with my partner. This relationship was particularly good for me and them, as we loved each other. Well, I suppose we did. My ex is non-binary and identifies as pansexual. Neither were, are, or will be a problem for me in the future with my future partners. Needless to say, this is personal information, I really hope that the moderators will allow this post to stay on the subreddit as I am using my past as a tool to share and maybe try and help other Mordekaiser mains in the future. Whatever the case, they claimed to have loved me. My partner, to say the least, had a problem with emotions. They felt really cold at times, I felt like they do not put the same effort as me into the relationship, not to mention some absurd requests which I cannot mention. But all relationships have flaws, and so did mine. Around a fortnight ago, I introduced my partner to one of my friends. At the time, it seemed like the right thing to do. She was also a part of the LGBT community, just like my partner. And considering it's not very easy to meet people like that in my country, I thought I was doing them a favor. So, they meet. We have fun, they seem to be enjoying each other's company. We have this group chat together. We'd send memes all the time, talk about stuff (unfortunately they were mostly dry and would only talk about their orientation, cats, and zodiac), and other stuff. I started being suspicious of them liking each other after a while. They started taking one another's side even when I was factiously right. Sometimes they would make me the villain, when I was right (Jayce and Viktor stuff). So after a while, I was insecure. They liked each other too much and I would regret meeting them nearly daily. At one point, they asked what is wrong. I told them it's because my partner is gonna leave me for you. They both assured me it will not happen. My partner said that they love me in a way they'll never love anyone again. My friend swore that she would also not do anything like that, ever. Lies, clearly. So time passes. Last night, they decide to tell me that they have caught feelings for one another. I was broken. I hated every minute of it. My worst nightmare came true. I ranted, I broke down. When the dust settled, I was hurt. I felt backstabbed. Just like Mordekaiser, I had been stabbed by my own Black Rose. I thought to myself. "Well, now I can use the Leblanc quote. Ahh the Black Rose, I remember your petty manipulations." And lying in my bed, laughing from the Black Rose quote for a while, I thought to myself. "Is this how I really go out?". And then I remembered.

I remembered our favorite character, Mordekaiser. I remembered that mere mortals cannot hold him down. I remembered that our will is bound to iron. This may seem daft to many of you, but he helped me realize. Mordekaiser helped me realize that this does not affect me. Twice slain, thrice born. The guy defied death. I can be like him too. Maybe I cannot defy death, but I can sure as hell have a tight leash on my life. That I make my own luck. No Black Rose, no death (being dumped and left for someone else), no fake pretenders to my throne can stop me. I have bent the realm of the dead (sad emotions and grief and torment) to my will, this world shall be next. This will only be another brick on my road to glory. 

And that is where you guys come in. I want you guys to take control of your lives too. This realm will bend to us, not the other way around. We're not souls, destined to wither away, we are the lords of the afterlife, the iron revenants. Let them resist or give in, let's show the world our potential. I want you guys to flourish with me. It's time to take control of our lives.

Thank you for reading. May you have a wonderful rest of your day, and remember, Iron Stands Eternal.<|endoftext|>-Frostfire Gauntlet

What items would yall recommend? I've been doing riftmaker and then going into other AP items. I was curious if there had been any success with everfrost or llandris? There stats seem good and their passive are also pretty great. Everfrost also seems good for chases and scaling. Also dark seal into mejias seems like a good pick up if your far ahead but I'm not sure tbh.

2. Runes
I have been running conquerer in my main and running domination as my second tree with relatively okay success. I saw some hail of blades builds that looks interesting and very bursty high damage. So I've been looking at trying it out.

Thanks guys and sorry for the long post.<|endoftext|>

I usually play towards a later game oriented build.  So basically I'm taking top Morde and putting him in the jungle with Conqueror, Triumph, Tenacity, Last Stand, Shield Bash and Revitalize.  I usually try and full clear by about 3:20, going red, krugs, raptors, wolves, blue and then gromp.  Unless I'm against something that clears insanely fast, I usually get to scuttle uncontested with a smite left.  But ganks are difficult because a flash is enough to get away from your pull, and you have to get somewhat close to pull them.  

This is solved by the fact that you play kind of passively and help the lanes that you can run them down in when the enemy gets pushed up.   And any flashes blown are a win as then you laner can expound on the pressure that gives, or you can gank again later and get a grab.  You also prioritize dragons more because of your ability to shred them with your passive and you also have a shield/heal to soak some damage from the drag.  



As for my build I usually go Red Smite, and then build into Riftmaker.  If I'm in to an AD heavy team, I'll go Bramble then finish my Rift, but If I'm into tanks or AP, I finish Rift and then start into either Zhonya's or Cosmic Drive, depending on their burst potential.  My final build usually looks like Riftmaker, Zhonya's, Cosmic Drive, Thornmail, Demonic Embrace, and MR Boots.  


I'm just curious how everyone clears the jungle compared to me and if anyone had any tips or tricks I might be missing<|endoftext|>

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/mtf9kt)<|endoftext|>I just played 3 games, 2 in gold 1 and 1 in plat 2. I won all 3 with insane KDA and I definitely will play more. Here are my set up and my thoughts on Mord Jungle.

Runes: take Conq, triumph, alarcrity/tenacity, last stand, raveneous hunter, zombie ward.

Raveneous hunter is very important, I remember one game we tried to 3 man baron at \~25 min, I literally healed on baron from 30% HP to 100% with it and riftmaker. If you get low after a fight, just find a jungle camp and you heal up to 100%.



Items: Blue smite is a must, DON'T BUY THE RED SMITE STARTER ITEM. If you check out the win rate on [op.gg](https://op.gg), blue smite has 52.6% win rate while red smite has 46% win rate. It's extremely important for Mord so Plz don't screw this up. I would miss so many kills without blue smite.

Buy boots first, Mercs, Steelcap, or cdr boots. The MS is really important for Mord. Dark seal is also a broken item if you are fed.

First item Riftmaker, then the item path is very flexible. Zhonya, demonic embrace, nashor, spirit visage, rylais are all fine and depends on the game. Usually you go for zhonya because it's broken as fuck.



Mord jungle is not good at ganking early game but his jungle clear is 100% the best in the game right now. You always do full clear and you are level 4 with full HP, the scuttle is most likely yours. You do a full clear again and you are \~level 6.



You work like Graves jungle, you don't have insane ganks but you win by being 3 levels up on the enemy jungler. He is definitely hidden OP.<|endoftext|>I hated them after the rework beacause of how braindead they are, i used to play the game for the gameplay like almost everyone else, but i fell in love with Mordekaiser's character and his fantasy, his passive being an all powerfull all consuming force around him wich kills everything in its path, the W is just badass as hell the chest pounds, the walk, the pose, it makes me grin like a maniac. Mordekaiser walking with his W active while the passive devours everything around him is the absolute best feeling ever for me.



Anyway thats why i love his W and Passive, let me know why you like them IF you do. Also let me know why you play Mordekaiser, gameplay or character/lore/fantasy.<|endoftext|>What can i do in a Sylas Matchup to go even/ahead?Last time i've played against him i've got wrecked,and i don't want that again!<|endoftext|>Im bronze 1 and i want to learn top.

Ty in advance GLHF (is it possible to punish vayne top im scared of her)<|endoftext|>I’ve been playing Morde jungle (in low elo norms and ranked flex, to be fair) and having TREMEDNOUS success. I’ve played it about 10 times, losing only once. My KDAs have been ridiculous in all 9 wins (16/1/9, 11/0/1, 9/2/6, etc.) His invades are unreal. Once you hit 6 you are doing Morde jungle wrong if you’re not invading. He can duel just about any jungler, and if laners collapse, he can ult to buy time for his laners and often secure a kill. His clear to get lvl 4 is fast, and no other dueling jungler can contest scuttle cause the other dueling junglers are lvl 3 still. (Unless they have lane priority obviously) And most importantly, his objective control is super strong. 

I’ve been running the normal precision tree runes (Conquerer) and resolve secondary (conditioning and revitalize). I also run ghost instead of flash, as his ganks are awful without it. 

I’m not saying Morde jungle is S tier. He has clear weaknesses, ganks being the most glaring. But I don’t understand why it’s being slept on, because every time I play it I legitimately feel like it’s really strong. I think by the time 11.9 rolls around people will realize how strong it is, and he will make some tier lists as an A tier jungler.

Edit: Always take red smite. This allows you to 1v1 people that have level leads on you.<|endoftext|>

I'm trying for the thrid time a mini-rework. This time I tried smaller by doing the W and passive swap we all want, with some twists left and right.

Obvious warning : the post is **not** short, and the numbers may be overkill. I'm just sharing ideas.



**Passive: Indestructible**

* Mordekaiser Shields himself for 25%-55% (Based on missing HP, max at 30%HP remaining) of the damage he deals (Half the value on minions), up to 25%-55% of his maximum HP (Based on missing HP, max at 30%HP remaining).

>The Shield decays by 1% of its max HP every second after not dealing or receiving damage for 3 seconds, to a minimum of 3-5% (based on level) of its max HP.  
>  
>As long as Mordekaiser has a shield from any source, he gains (10%AP) bonus Armor and Magic Resist.

* Mordekaiser also converts 20%-40% (based on level) of his AD into AP, his basic attack deals (25%AP+15%AD) bonus magic damage and can apply items “ability-only” passives effect.



**Q – Obliterate**

>CD: 10/8.5/7/5.5/4 sec

* Active (0.5 second cast): Mordekaiser Smashes the ground in a target direction, dealing 65/85/105/125/145 (+60%AP) (+45%AD) magic damage. Hitting an isolated target increase the damage by 30/35/40/45/50% and apply on-hit effects.



**W – Harvester of Sorrow**

>CD: 16/14/12/10/8 sec

* Passive: Mordekaiser gains bonus experience when killing minions near allies equal to 50% of the experience he lost due to them being there. ^(guess who's back ?)
* Active: Mordekaiser surrounds himself with a cloud of magic and metal shards for 4 seconds, dealing 30/40/50/60/70 (+30%AP) (+5% target max health) magic damage per seconds to all enemies around himself, and gains 4-8% (based on level) bonus movement speed.

>Basics attacks and abilities other than Harvester of Sorrow refresh the duration.

Recasting or waiting the spell’s end activate the second effect, and ending the AoE effect and its bonuses.

* Recast: Mordekaiser constrict the area, dealing 50/80/110/140/170 (+30%AP) magic damage to all enemies near himself, and heals himself for the same amount, capped up to 1/1/2/2/3 enemy champions. Healing is reduced to 25% for minions.



**E – Death’s Grasp**

>can be used while moving  
>  
>CD: 14/12/10/8/6 sec

* Active: Mordekaiser summon a magical square in an area. After 0.5 seconds, the square explodes with death magic, dealing 60/80/100/120/140 (+60% AP) (+40% AD) magic damage to all enemies in the area and marking all enemies hit with “Creeping Death” for 2 seconds.

>Death’s Grasp can be recast as long as there are enemies marked with “Creeping Death”, doing so will drag all enemies marked over 250 units towards the cursor and consume the mark.

* Hitting enemies with “Obliterate” will also consume the mark and give Mordekaiser “Mace of Spade” effect (maximum 6 stacks).

>“Mace of Spade” doubles the bonus magic damage dealt by Mordekaiser’s passive for his next basic attack.  
>  
>Hitting minions or small monsters gives 1 stack, hitting champions or large monsters gives 3 stacks instead.

Enemy champions cannot be marked again for the next 20/18/16/14/12 seconds if “Creeping Death” is consumed.



**R – Realm of Death**

>CD: 160/130/100

* Passive: Mordekaiser steal 3% of all the stats of any champion that dies near him, keeping the stolen stats until they respawn
* Active: Mordekaiser slows the target enemy champion by 80% during the cast time, after which they're banished together with Mordekaiser to the Death Realm for 7 seconds.

>For the same duration, Mordekaiser also steal 10% (+1% per 75AP) of every single stats of the target enemy champion. If the enemy dies while inside the Death Realm, Mordekaiser keep their stolen stats until they respawn.  
>  
>Enemies that Cleanse the Death Realm are weakened for 15 sec, losing an additional 10% on all their stats on top of the initial stats lost. Mordekaiser however doesn’t gain any of the lost stats.  
>  
>No interaction between the Living World and the Death Realm is possible.

which runes you using when playing top ? I use Hail of Blades, bcs of AS, and it's working actually
yeah, I know, Conq is better, but did you tried with Hail of Blades ? against tanks is so powerful<|endoftext|>

Its way cheaper than riftmaker with a smiliar stat line, 40 less ap, 5 ah, 100 hp, but its 700g cheaper. Also you get the cherry on top of healing your allies. Thoughts?<|endoftext|>This mean that a single Q can proc his passive fully on both wolf and raptor.

The fact that this isn't on the patch note might indicate that this is a bug and isn't intended, tho.<|endoftext|>I've had a few games Vs nasus and each playstyle I have tried doesn't work, I have no kill pressure on him at any point of the game, and if I play safely he will just scale out of control.  How do you guys respond to a Nasus top? Or is this matchup just a dodge.<|endoftext|>I started playing Morde top a few months ago and every time i get teemo as the enemy i win the lane, it dosent matter if the teemo is a first timer or a 400k m7 no life teemo main i always destroy them, but this should not be the case cuz teemo counters morde didnt he? 

Its just me or anyone else finds teemo an easy win nowadays?<|endoftext|>I find it hard sometimes to find the right items to build on someone. But I have been building riftmaker on him recently and it honestly doesn't feel great. When I play Sett and finish my stride breaker I feel the power of being able to use it instantly but with Morde it's just kinda like, "ok I got my riftmaker. onto the next item" So what mythic do you guys take in what situations and generally what else do you build.<|endoftext|>Riftmaker

Pros

* Powerfull sustain in and out of champion combat
* Complements Mordekaiser's playstyle
* Good combination of stats
* Excellent Mythic Passive
* Good synergy with Demonic Embrace

Cons

* Even if it complements Mordekaiser well it's still a terrible item
* Squishy
* Needs 2 extra items to feel on the same power as other Mythics
* Passive does not do enough

Sunfire

Pros

* Excellent stats
* Synergyzes with Mordekaiser's Passive and Demonic Embrace REALLY hard
* Most powerfull pure dueling Mythic item for Mordekaiser
* It's damage output is reliable and offers Mordekaiser a way to output heavy damage without the need to hit skillshots on hyper mobile fighters (Irelia and such)
* Enables frontline offtank builds

Cons

* Worst Mythic passive in the game
* Useless if you are getting kited
* No out of combat sustain since Ravenous its useless



Let me know if i missed something, i also want to know your toughts on this.<|endoftext|> 

Riftmaker 

91.05% Pick rate 

52,071 Games played

52.49% Win rate

Riftmaker is overall Mordekaiser's best item, its a good general purpose choice for him, even if Rocketbelt has a higher win rate Riftmaker's pick rate is 52 times higher, if you are not sure what to build you can never go wrong with this item.

    

Hextech Rocketbelt 

2.11% Pick rate 

1,205 Games played 

53.69% Win rate

His low pick rate but high win rate indicates a good situational item, you can use this item into heavy Ranged comps to close the distance and quite possibly assassinate one of the enemy ranged champions, they tend to have really low Magic Resist so the Mythic passive can add tons of damage. Useful in specific situations.

Note: The item is loosing 100 HP and gaining 6 Magic Penetration next patch.

    

Sunfire Aegies 

1.99% Pick rate  

1,140 Games playes 

52.11% Win rate

Sunfire Aegis is a relatively new choice mostly a meme at the start, it would appear that it actually is an ok item for Mordekaiser. The item's performance is pretty good with a pick rate extremely similar to Hextech Rocketbelt and a lower but still good win rate, indicates a good item for games in wich you need to be the frontline of your team or alternatively, a good item into heavy melee comps in wich the item is given the time it requires to ramp up and start dealing extreme sustained damage. Seems to be a good item, inferior to Riftmaker but still a powerful addition in the right teamcomp. No item Mordekaiser can build offers as much sustained damage as Sunfire but it can be also the less reliable one given that it needs for you stick to targets to start its ramp up, something that Mordekaiser HEAVILY struggles with.

    

Data gathered from [U.GG](https://u.gg/) from Platinum elo EUW.

Why platinum ? it's a good bridge between high and low elo and the sample size is decently big, enough to make assumptions about item power.

Any question is welcome and also any of your toughts or things that you think i missed are welcome.<|endoftext|>I really want to know if there is any server out there. I made one myself and I really want to know if I should keep the server or if I should delete it.<|endoftext|>Now here's a somewhat new format of a rework concept for Morde. Unlike some other concepts, which switched around his W and passive in an attempt to make him feel more like pre-rework Mordekaiser and have more skill expression and make him feel less dull, I'm accepting the fact that Mordekaiser is now the way he is, and the likelihood of Riot deciding to actually revert his W/Passive is extremely low, therefore, I want to try to make his current kit feel as good as possible (mostly)without making any unrealistic changes.

Now what I believe that Mordekaiser's main two problems are a severe lack of defensive base stats in the later stages of the game and a lack of good items to build, because of this lack of items, his damage has been power crept (On release, his rank 5 isolation bonus is equal to what his rank 1 isolation bonus is now.)

So in this mini-rework concept, I'll be toning down his damage a bit while giving him a lot more self-utility throughout his entire kit. I'll also be giving him a LOT of extra durability in the 2 different W changes I thought of. In both concepts, using W will grant you bonus resistances as long as the shield is active, which is why I'm not fully reverting his armor per level. One of the concepts is unquestionably stronger than the other, but I felt like it would just be really cool to have a huge, thick, menacing ~~COCK~~ shield to dominate your enemies with. Although, I will be adding a unique interaction to his shield which prevents you from stacking shields because I will be adding some hybrid scaling to his passive and his Q which would allow him to build typical bruiser items such as Sterak's and Death's Dance, and even now, imagining a fully stacked Mordekaiser shield with a fully stacked Sterak's shield would make us cry tears of joy but make people playing against us break some monitors.

In addition to his extra tankiness/build diversity, be giving him better sticking potential through a few changes to his passive and E, which you'll see later on in the post. 

Without further ado, here are the changes:

Base Stat Changes:

* Base AD reduced to 58 from 61
* Armor per level increased to 3.25 from 3
* Base HP increased to 580 from 575.
* HP per level increased to 95 from 90

(Giving Mordekaiser slightly better HP numbers and slightly below average armor per level for a juggernaut, not giving him completely normal numbers because of the changes I want to make to his W)

Passive- Darkness Rise:

Innate(bonus on-hit damage):

* Now has a base damage of 5-40(based on level)
* AP scaling reduced to 30% from 40%
* Added an 80% bAD scaling
* On-hit damage now applies to turrets at 50% effectiveness.

Darkness Rise:

* AP scaling reduced to 25% from 30%
* Added a 40% AD scaling
* Now increases to a 5/9%(levels 1/9) movement speed bonus when moving towards enemy champions.

(Changing the innate bonus damage to give Morde back some of his hybrid scalings from before the rework. It's only a small amount of scaling so that AD builds on Mordekaiser aren't exploitable or oppressive, but it still allows to build more typical bruiser items like Sterak's or Death's Dance.)

Q- Obliterate:

* Isolation damage reduced to 125/130/135/140/145% from 140/145/150/155/160
* Removed the +5-140 bonus damage(based on level)
* Added a 15% to 75% AD scaling(based on level)

(Reducing the unnecessarily over buffed isolation damage to a more reasonable amount, and adding a bonus AD scaling for the same reason as I stated in my passive notes. 75% may just be a tad bit too much, even if it's only going to be in the later stages of the game. Feedback about these two changes, in particular, would be appreciated.)

W- Indestructible(Concept 1):

* Double-tapping W now instantly grants the heal from the ability
* The potential shield stored against large/epic monsters is no longer reduced.
* Maximum Shield amount reduced to 25%HP from 30%HP.
* Duration increased to 5 seconds from 4.
* Now grants 10/15/20/25/30(+10% Armor) bonus armor and 5/10/15/20/25(+10% MR) Magic resistance. while active.
* Added a unique interaction that reduces additional shields received by 30% on Mordekaiser while the W shield is active.

(Now this is the big change I think will solve some of Mordekaiser's biggest problems. Right now, he does more than enough damage, especially in 1v1s, but he literally just gets melted in teamfights, even with a fully stacked W shield, kinda like [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/PeacefulSuperPastaBCWarrior-esFrivRf8Xx_cyqn). Because his armor per level is abysmally low, and the fact that MR is really hard to get outside of Spirit Visage, he has no way of actually surviving for more than a couple of seconds if he gets focused down by anyone with DPS. Now, I understand that with this change, he would feel unkillable with a fully stacked W shield+fully stacked Sterak's shield, so I added the last bit that reduces his ability to stack shields)

W- Indestructible(Concept 2):

* The first 2 QoL Changes from the first concept remain the same in this concept.
* Maximum shield changed to 20-30%HP(based on level)
* Sheild amount increases by 50% when nearby an enemy champion and 25% for each nearby champion beyond the first.
* Sheild duration reduced to 3 seconds from 4.
* Now grants 10% bonus Armor and Magic Resistance while active.
* Added a unique interaction that reduces additional shields received by 50% on Mordekaiser while the W shield is active.

(So basically this makes him an ultra-tank when he's in the middle of a huge fight, and because of that, I'm increasing the shield stacking reduction further so that he doesn't just gain 3 health bars worth of shields in the middle of a teamfight. The bonus armor and magic resist are staying in this concept, although to a lesser degree because of the over-the-top shield amount he can get if the ability is utilized properly.)

E- Death's Grasp:

* Base damage reduced to 60/75/90/105/120 from 80/95/110/125/140.
* AP scaling reduced to 40% from 60%.
* Now slows all units hit by 10/15/20/25/30% for 0.5 seconds.

(This ability is perfect as it is, but to increase Morde's sticking potential, I'm reducing its damage so that I can add a small slow as a reward for hitting the ability.)

R- Realm of Death:

* Now grants further bonus stats upon successfully killing the banished target. The stats stolen while in the Death remain unchanged(10%)
* Core stats stolen changed to AP, AD, HP, and Attack speed. (Removed Armor and MR so that he doesn't just become unkillable in combination with his W/higher base armor.) 
* If the banished target kills Mordekaiser within the duration, they gain his stats instead.
* Bonus stats upon killing the target or Mordekaiser 15/17.5/20% of core stats. (VERY UNREALISTIC IDEA AND WOULD LIKELY BE OP IF IMPLEMENTED. PLEASE DO NOT CRUCIFY ME IN THE COMMENTS I JUST THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE COOL)
* (Serious Change) Mordekaiser gains true sight of the banished target for 3/3.5/4 seconds(even if they cleanse it or use QSS).
* Duration changed to 5/6/7 from 7 at all ranks.

(Basically, I just wanted to see if anyone would think getting more out of leveling up your ult would be an idea anyone wanted to see. I added the risk/reward potential so that it's as devastating for your team if you just ult a fed carry at the wrong time. Also, it stops the trend of people using ult to stall with their W and Zhonyas if you ult someone you can't kill. The true sight of the target is a decently large buff, so as a way to somewhat even it out, the ult duration will be reduced early on.)

Anyways, there it is, my (maybe) final attempt to make Mordekaiser feel better to play overall. In my opinion, this covers most of Mordekaiser's current problems while still making him somewhat balanced and opening up his build paths more. His counters will still counter him(He's still weak to mages and poke, mobile champions can still outmaneuver his Q and E, although stealth champions will be slightly less effective against him whenever he has his ult up.) But at least now he has a better fighting chance and can be picked in more situations.

I'm hoping that since this subreddit is full of the most devoted and passionate Mordekaiser players(or old, nostalgia-driven Morde mains), I will be able to get some healthy and constructive criticism from everyone here, as well as any other ideas that you think would be cool or make Morde feel more himself.<|endoftext|>

I also kinda want morde w to absorb the souls around him and grant him a bigger shield based on how many souls he has. for example, killing a minion stacks a soul into his w, killing a champion gives him 5, and stacks up to 10-20 scaling on level. each soul gives him a base or percentage amount of armour and MR, or gives him a bigger shield. recasting sucks the souls back into morde, and instead of gaining instant HP morde gains more hp but it slowly comes to him over time, maybe through the span of 5-10 seconds. this would add a lil bit of a skillcap to morde and make him really interesting as a champion. may our bonk king reign supreme again!<|endoftext|>When you W you get the circle like the old W and it deal damage like the passive but when your passive run to it then it it will make a/an explode and slow the enemy

Hello Summoners,

I am currently studying the extent to which the player experience in League of Legends impacts the mental health of young people, with the end goal being both a thesis, and presentation in which I express my results and any conclusions I find along the way.

However, due to recent restrictions caused by Covid-19, I have been unable to collect data through conventional means. I am reaching out to you in hopes that you would be willing to participate in a short survey for me. Below I have attached a survey which consists of basic questions regarding personal experience, playtime, and overall impact on mental health. The survey should only take about 5-10 minutes and it would mean the world to me if you could take it. Thank you in advance.

What’s everyone think?<|endoftext|>As I mentioned, how does the rune Revitalize work on Morde W?

Morde W gives him a big ass shield and then recasting it consumes the shield to heal for a % of the remaining amount.

The rune increases the shielding and healing. So in my head it would increase the shield amount, then the reactivation would account for the increased shield AND the increased healing. making it multiplicative.

Is this how it works, or does it just increases one of the parts?<|endoftext|>I main Master Yi and I also play Viego and Skarner with a little bit of Kha Zix thrown in there, I started off playing Top and I loved playing Mordekaiser, now he can play jungle, any tips on how to play him in jungle?

Morde is tanky anyway he doesnt rlly need riftmaker

and dmg from riftmaker isnt comparable with liandrys

And pair that with Demonic and Thornmail u got some crazy dmg antiheal and tankiness

Then maybe buy cosmic drive for some cdr and movement speed and force of nature or spirit if u want more sustain ur not only

tanky but u do insane burn damage <|endoftext|>

Im a plat 2 morde otp hoping to get diamond soon and i got bored so heres a matchupsheet i made, its completely based on my own opinions and experiences would love to discuss some of my choices, also alot of matchups would be easier or harder if i was higher elo. heres my acc if anyone was wondering [https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=juiceslurper420](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=juiceslurper420)<|endoftext|>a bit of background, i liked to sometimes use old shurelia and spirit visage in season 10 since they gave alot heal/shield power and so in 11.18 i saw the new patch notes and decided, it gives ap, health, heal and shield power and good in drawn out fights, so i went with volibear first and it was really insane how he could heal for 36% missing hp and shield for close to 40% max hp alongside buffing the flat shield he gets from ap so i thought, oh nice this might be a nice little gimmick i can try with morde.



i am either seeing things or ive done too much crack but from what ive seen on morde, i stacked as much heal and shield power possible and when i shield, not only do i get like an 80% max hp shield BUT, since the healing from that shield is 50% of it BUT THEN was buffed by the heal and shield power i have i started to get some interesting numbers, also since conqueror healing isnt reduced by aoe damage, heal and shield power spam can increase that to around 22% aoe omnivamp.



tldr im not saying this is a new meta for morde but, heal and shield power increasing your shielding which then increases the healing gained from the shield which is increased further from heal and shield power just deadass gave me sensory overload with the heal numbers i was seeing.



tldr tldr, i was outhealing the 2 nexus turrets with just my W and Qing a single target dummy on cooldown<|endoftext|>If so what do you build?<|endoftext|>When was the last time we heard any news of riot doing something to mordekaisers W any updates since then? 
My biggest worry is that they just give him placebo buffs that are useless in the long run and keep him below sinking line as they are currently doing with his Q damage. Everyone is on the same page at this point that he is a stat stick and his W is one of the most boring abilities in the game, even LS thinks so. Mordekaiser is too much of a stat stick and needs to get a mini rework to move away from that concept.<|endoftext|>it drives me crazy with so many gap closers in the game a champion can literally stand on top of you and not take dmg.

Also Q should deal damage if you die but the animation goes off<|endoftext|>

Are they really gona do it? Why they are not releasing news about it? Time passing and the only thing I got during this period is that Mark loves Mordekaiser...

If morde's passive lost some damage potential but gained Gwen's mists ability to mitigate damage from outside he would have the ability to combat ranged heros better.

Tldr: Maybe Mordes passive should limit/reduce damage done from outside allowing for the lord to duel/deal with ranged heros.<|endoftext|>They keep giving us useless buffs when at this point morde items suck at best<|endoftext|>Anyone else having problems where people can leap or flash out of Morde's ult?<|endoftext|>Noob question: outside of laning phase do you (and if so when do you) ult....

The Mythic Passive seems ok since it gives AP.  
It lacks Omni-Vamp so im a bit hesitant on doing this tbh due to lack of sustain  
The active is really nice when you time it well with your E or when you managed to slow the by your Rylai and use it.  
Rylai and Everfrost work well and so do some other items like Azakanas due to the slow being able to let you activate the passive on it more.  


And now that im done here, try it out and tell me what you think of it?<|endoftext|>Can someone explain the alliance stuff between morde and astrox<|endoftext|>

https://preview.redd.it/mzwhmm1981r61.png?width=269&format=png&auto=webp&s=5437171c54bf7bbcef1e19515e568de33ef27965<|endoftext|>I was thinking about this rune as a more tank option.

What do you think?<|endoftext|>"Content to stand idly by the formation of the Universe, content to stand by as the Gods of Order and Chaos waged war. Content to stand alone as Chaos slew Order, he collected. The Mordekaiser has waited for eons, collecting the souls of the fallen, adding to his own power. What began as a lowly and lesser God, has over the millennia, grown incomprehensible. He has stood alone for centuries, and now The Mordekaiser grows tired of waiting."

So y'all know how Riot toned down the Ultimate skins and form-shifting due to memory constraints or whatever? How Seraphine had to be a three-part skin that, tbh could have been done better?

I got to thinking, right? The Seraphine skins could be a way to circumvent the form-shifting mechanic, and could usher in a new age of Ultimate skins.

in Dota2 there are items call Arcana and Immortal, which are super-high tiered cosmetic items that, for some, will change models depending on what you do with them, such as fulfill certain criteria. A lot like Seraphine's Ultimate skins, where she gets a series of quests to unlock the next tier of skins.

I thought about how Morde could have a skin similar to that, that tracks souls claimed in the Death Realm, similar to Eternals, but skin-only. If you claim enough souls, you unlock the next tier of Mordekaiser.

I have very little design to go off of here, aside from the Ultimate:

At first rank, the Ultimate brings you to a nameless battlefield, in a foregotten era. Sand shifts as the wind blows it around you, with the sound of clashing metal and the howls of war. As you level up the Ultimate by claiming souls, the battlefield becomes littered with weapons. Swords sticking blade-first into the ground, polearms litter the floor, torn warbanners flutter in the wind.

As the Skin-Level progresses, is shows Mordekaiser's rise to power, from a simple soldier-spirit to all-encompassing ruler of both life and death.

At final Skin-Level, the Ultimate would bring you to Mordekaiser's final Imperium, his golden-black halls of Mitna Rachnun, as the souls of the worthy cheer and scream your name.

This all came to me on a walk.

I need to go on more walks.<|endoftext|>the scenario was this me (mordekaiser) vs renekton i reach level 6 first i ult him but he got 6 during my ult because minion died, i thought during shadow realm you are in a different realm so you should not get xp from minions<|endoftext|>Basically an item that gives like 40 AP 500HP and 10 ability haste which has 2 passives:

1) Gain ability power equal to 2% of your total HP.

2) Deal 4 + 1.5% of your total HP per second for 3 seconds when you apply spell damage.<|endoftext|>What if Viego and Mordekaiser switched ults. I thought about it for a second and for as crazy as it sounds... It feels....right. Viego much like the other skirmishers feels like a stat-checker but his Ult doesn't feel all that grandiose considering how sorta bland his other basic abilities are, with his passive being the most memorable part. It's this nature though that feels like he'd be better suited for a Camille style Ult and playing up the possession you might not even realize your top/mid/jungle/adc/support is no longer your ally. Viego would be so broken with it yes, but it also feels right for him seeing as how he his whole gimmick really feels more suited to that 1v1 that Morde Ult provides. On the other side, Morde's kit feels like even a miniscule dash like Viego' would actually add some much needed mobility to the champion. Being so slow yet so tanky being able to unstoppably Ult into the enemy team proc passive off of hitting 3 people's seems soo hectic. I love it but I know this would break the game lol.<|endoftext|>

I come from the Darius main and I was thinking in picking up Morde to have as a counter pick into some match ups or when Darius gets banned. I was wondering how well does morde performs against some match ups like Teemo, Urgot, Nasus? These are the ones that usually ban Darius. Thank you in advance<|endoftext|>Hi there, non-Mordekaiser player here.

I've seen you all feel the same based on your comments on the latest buffs, and I want to share my opinions as an outsider:

Bonus damage on q won't do anything because it's an incredibly easy hability to dodge/okay around: If you want Morde to be a somewhat good duelist/laner, Q needs a bit more range or less CDR early, otherwise it's a shit hability to control the lane, and it's only good when you ult someone because you can corner them.

That being said, I don't think Morde's Q is the problem to make the champ somewhat interesting (because let's be honest, he is fucking boring compared to 90% of the champs, not only new ones)

Morde is only a press R champ: He can't sidelane, he can't duel most non tank toplaners, gets countered by 1300g. The only good thing about the champ is that he can ult the jungler when doing dragon/baron, or when paired against tanks, which again, is very fucking boring.

What my suggestions would be:

1-)Make him a tank: If hes gonna be useless at least make him a tank, change his passive from doing damage to getting Mr and armor the more champs he gets in his zone, that way you benefit good Mordekaiser players That can e because today, even if he misses all Qs and Es, he still wins a lot of 1v1s in his ult for some reason (that doesn't necessarily mean kill them.

2-) Change his W or R: I know a lot of you might enjoy his shadow realm thing but what kind of shit game play is get ulted and start running away because if you face him you will die. It's straight up not fun.

And his W is just an objectively worse version than old W.

Overall I think Morde'e E is the most interesting ability, so it should stay as it is, and Q makes a lot of sense when paired with E, so that's fine, but passive, w and R have a long way to go before being semiinteresting<|endoftext|>Hes getting buffs constantly its getting harder and harder. Last season we had wits end. But no point after no healing. I was building shieldbow this season. But its also pointless after removal of extra lifesteal. I only can kill him lvl 2 if he doesnt unlock shield. But thats all. He just statchecks me entire game. If he ults me im dead %100. qss doesnt feel very good at laning phase. Too much wasted gold. Im thinking about zerkers into hexdrinker. Then stride. But there is a problem. Hex and steraks doesnt stack. Halp.<|endoftext|>Something to hearken back to the good ol' days of Mordekaiser.

Bring back Iron Man. Sorta.

Change W so that it is still the active charging mechanic, but when you activate it, instead of constantly dissipating, turn it into Iron Man. All damage that you deal is converted into shields, a-la current W shielding, but make it half as effective so you don't get massive shields outta complete nowhere.

Helps him feel like old Morde, not a Q buff, and might actually help him with his tankiness.<|endoftext|>

But i didn’t rush any tank items.  Any advice? Strategies?<|endoftext|>Hi guys 

there is a build I’ve been doing a lot and I am having a great success with it . Ill give the runes and the build and I’ll tell you why this build is so strong 

Runes : conquerer triumph legend tenacity or alacrity last stand conditioning revitalize 

Build : rift maker demonic embrace spirit visage thornmail gargoyle stone plate 

Why I think this build is the strongest build ever existed for mordekaiser?

Mordekaiser main survival tool is his w shield which is not great of an ability unless you using this build.

Health: makes able to take more damage then u should be

Healing : Thanks to rift maker ,conquerer and triumph sustain you have so much confidence on taking long trades but healing main counter is grievous wounds and burst damage 
 
Shields : mordekaiser’ w and gargoyle stone plate’s active shields is great way to counter burst damage and sustain while being low on health and since there is no item that counters shields except serpents fangs

Resistance: almost all items you build give you resistance and demonic embrace give resistance for each enemy are on the burn effect and gargoyle also give you resistance for each enemy hitting you and conditioning to amp the resistance 

Most of the mordekaiser players building full ap which is extremely high damage but what’s the point of having so much damage while not staying in team fights long enough to deal it ?

With this build you literally have every surviving methods while also being almost the highest dps champion in your team  and extremely hard to kill frontline you gonna heal so much cause of your damage and you will never get bursted thanks to shields you get from your w and gargoyle that’s is also amped from revitalize and spirit visage and if that is not enough ur resistance are almost 300 during team fight that’s almost 80% damage reduction 
I have footage of me playing this build and i was literally 1 v 9 the enemy team .

But there is somethings you need to keep in mind always try use your w or gargoyle when u below 40 % health so you get the shields amp and heal during the shield effects and never use gargoyle when your w is ready and if you ult there tanks and you stole there stats man you are literally immortal.

Please share your thoughts on this build and tell me what do you think.<|endoftext|>

This change would nerf decently hard what Is most infuriating about him wich is his R being pretty much a death sentence for melee champions while also giving Mordekaiser a reason to actually max it other then cooldown.

As a compensation 
Armor 37 to 39. Armor growth 3 to 4. Health growth 90 to 100. Also Mordekaiser now converts 50%/75%/100% levels 1/8/13 of AD he gains from items to AP.

I dont need to explain the armor and health buffs, now the juicy part, the convertion, this would allow him to have good build diversity and give him access to the good bruiser defensive items.<|endoftext|>Hey yall.

It's very simple my little aluminum kitchenware, i'll tell you my secrets so you too can start storing more energy into your Lithium Powersource(LP).

Ask yourself this : how many times did a person just walk away from you after using their ONE(1) mobility spell/item? Probably quite a few times yea? Then, ask yourself this : Did flash help you chase them down? You probably answered with : yea i managed to land the auto attack needed for my passive to activate and then i walked behind him for the next 4 seconds. Probably didn't work out too well most of the time huh?  


Well what if i told you, there is a way for YOU, since minute ONE(1) to get all the juice in the world needed to run your short aluminum legs? You ask what is it? You beg me to tell you the secrets to becoming the Iron Revenant? Okay.  


What most people overlook is that Morde is actually dead, a spirit. Most people think he is kennen and should be lightning fast, like some sort of superhero called... Blink? Streak? Something like that i don't know, so everyone gets FLASH as their primary summoner spell. But you see, morde isn't a lightning squirrel, he is in fact, a ghost. That's right. And for you to fully realize mordes potential, you have to acknowledge it. As we all know, ghosts are very scary, that's why people run from you if you activate ghost (because then you're a double ghost!), but again, as we all know, ghosts are also extremely fast, and ignore collision(not walls tho, contrary to popular belief).   


So the question is this : Why take a summoner that lets you land one auto attack or one Q, when you can LITERALLY, chase their whole team down?

TLDR; Stop going flash, get ghost.

I recently started playing Leage of Legends and I really like morde and want to make him my main.  But rn I don't know much about how to properly play it, so if you can give me any tips I would really appreciate them :D<|endoftext|>Your champion is literally busted btw<|endoftext|>Mordekaiser is, among his peers (Juggernaut) close to worst-in-class for several very important stats. 

For Armor growth, he's tied with Garen (who gets free armor) and only loses to Trundle (who for some reason has the worst armor growth in the game outside special cases mini gnar and thresh?). His base armor is actually pretty decent. 

He's got the second lowest base health of all Juggernauts, only outdone by Nasus. His health growth stat is subpar but not too much of an outlier - Garen, Urgot and Mundo are lower than him and he's tied with Aatrox, Volibear, and Nasus. 

Finally, and probably the biggest nail in his proverbial coffin, is Movespeed. Not helping him here either is his relatively large hitbox (the highest in the game, tied with most other juggernauts and a few tanks). Of all melee juggernauts, he has the lowest movespeed at 335. Only Urgot, the ranged juggernaut, is worse with 330. I'd also like to point out that every melee champion in the 335 movespeed bracket either has a dash or on-demand movement speed buff, by the way. Except Tahm Kench, who got his nerfed after his mini rework in Season 9 . 

Now granted, his passive does grant movement speed, but it only grants enough to bring it to essentially 'standard' juggernaut levels. It gives him roughly 10 movespeed and a little extra after tier two boots. Juggernauts dominate the 350 movespeed bracket, with four of the eight champions there. Most fall into the 345 bracket, but there are a handful (notably Darius and Illaoi who lack any way to increase MS in their kits) that are 340. 

Being a Juggernaut, these stats I'd say are pretty important. Armor late game when you're a big target to click on, early health to not be a total punching bag in lane, and movement speed for all stages of the game are particularly important for juggernauts. 

**TL;DR Best stats to buff are Armor Growth, Base Health, and Movespeed because his suck compared to other juggernauts. Rito pls**<|endoftext|>

And is the build on [u.gg](https://u.gg) the best one? I feel like he gets 1v1ed by so many characters top if he isn't ahead, or have a better teamfight, if you take into account QSS, and I'm doing well in my games but I'd like to know what I'm supposed to do when I get into higher elo and I need to start playing around my team more and having a deep understanding of my champion.<|endoftext|>Maybe a black ice skin like Renekton and Rek Sai maybe making the Death Realm a frozen palace that would be super cool maybe Lissandra's throne room ?<|endoftext|>Since the Ravenous Hunter rune is likely going to be nerfed to shit yet again, I think Riot could do something about Mordekaiser's lack of any real lane sustain in his kit. And no, I'm not counting his W as lane sustain because its lengthy cooldown and measly 12% max health heal (when fully stacked) at rank 1 makes it an awful source of sustain.

So here's an idea to change up his kit just a bit to give Mordekaiser a means to gaining back some health without having to rely on omnivamp way too much.

Death's Grasp:

Remove "Passive: Mordekaiser gains 5 / 7.5 / 10 / 12.5 / 15% magic penetration."

And replace it with

"Passive: Enemies affected by Death's Grasp/Realm of Death are marked for X seconds. Being hit by Mordekaiser's attacks or abilities consumes the mark, healing Mordekaiser for Y% of his max health for each mark. Healing is 50% effective from marked minions, 200% when in the Death Realm."

X could be around 3 to 5 seconds. While Y could be between 2% to 4% of his max health, either as a flat amount or scaling on skill rank.

Personally, I think Morde's W can remain as it is. Maybe give it an extra effect such as its cooldown being reduced by isolated Q hits against champions or being hit by an enemy ability every few seconds. As a tradeoff, get rid of the shield-to-heal conversion.

A potentially OP idea is to give his W an effect something like: "Activating Indestructible makes Mordekaiser immune to any execution effects for a few seconds." (i.e Collector passive won't proc on him, same with Pyke's Ult and Urgot's Ult.)

Are the ideas any good? Are they completely terrible? Maybe we can discuss and hopefully get Riot to give Mordekaiser a meaningful gameplay tweak?<|endoftext|>I want to know what is meta on Mordekaiser. Ap or Tank or an mix of both?<|endoftext|>I've played Mordekaiser a number of times in the current season and he's one of my favorite champions, but it's been difficult most of the time since it feels like he's extremely match-up based. I've been having experiences with him where I either do really well and still lose because I somehow get quite a few kills or I have to be carried. I'm also not sure if I'm even playing Morde right tbh, I believe his usual combo is E Q auto or just smack them over and over while they try to cs, but is there any advice as to be **smarter** with Morde? I've had more success with Tank-kaiser than AP (I dont know if that says anything about me as a player or my matchup, idk). I know there are players here that are more familiar with him than I am. **Any advice** would be dope.<|endoftext|>With the upcoming ritual gutting of Seeker's, I've been running some math on decent defensive alternatives. 

First off, I think Warden's mail might be a bit overlooked as an armor option. Chain vest is technically the most efficient use of gold and space if you're just grabbing armor, but with the additional gutting of healing in the game, bramble might not be the go-to option for us instead of seeker's either. I especially don't like thornmail because it depends on hitting E to be good, I vastly prefer oblivion orb and morello if I need grevious. If you want to go Deadman's, sure get chain vest, but I think Randuin's might be worth considering in a lot more games with Warden's mail as an early pickup. 

As for Magic resist, I think far and away visage is the best on us, not close. We essentially get the bonuses squared from it, since we increase the shield, and then if we recast W we get the bonus applied AGAIN for the heal. 

For Tank Morde players, I think these two are probably the scariest 2 item defensive package (outside of your mythic). Hell even for bruiser Morde players, if you pick one of these up third I think you'll be pretty happy. Should game go late picking both up in a Riftmaker + 2 AP item build is going to be good in a lot of games. They're quite cheap as well, so that's a bonus. 

But what might be the not-so-secret sauce is Gargoyle's stoneplate. I think unless you absolutely need the stopwatch for something specific, this is just the better anti burst item if you weren't sitting on a seeker's already. It's just expensive, but if you're fed and need to 1v9 this item is very big stonks if you are living in every enemy's head rent-free and they're always hitting you first. 

Anyway, reject Zhonya's, return to tanke<|endoftext|>

[I still don't know how i won that](https://reddit.com/link/m5bose/video/6h00mqyo24n61/player)<|endoftext|>I love Mordekaiser, hate how he no longer has much build diversity that compliments his unique AP Juggernaut gameplay. This along with my love for other battle mages has inspired me to make up some Manaless Mage Mythics Rework around Catalyst being made a manaless item. Let me know what you think! 
----

In this edition of "reddit does game design". I designed a way to bring back Catalyst (reworked) and update the manaless mage mythics so that they have synergy with extended combat like rift maker? Here's my design ideas:

Catalyst: Now builds out of Ruby Gem + Amp Tome. Passive: After damaging an enemy with an ability, for several seconds gain increased health regeneration. If your champ has mana, also grant mana regeneration.

The 3 Mana-less mage mythics now all build out of Catalyst and another component, united like the Lost Chapter Mage mythics.

The updated effects are modal, in that they offer both burst mages and sustained damage mages passives.

- Riftmaker (The Vamp Option): Builds out of Leeching Leer and Catalyst. Passive: Same as now, but add 'purple chains of corruption' vfx that represent the Lifesteal effect from enemies. Lifegain occurs over a handful of seconds.

- Night Harvester (The Multi-kill Option): Builds out of Catalyst and Fiendish Codex. Passive: Nearly same as now. Enemy champs stack up to 3 stacks of Harvest. Upon taking damage, stacks are removed all at once and the burst is applied. They recharge every 15 seconds, up to 3 max. Upon activation of Harvest, you gain increased move speed dependent on number of stack consumed.

- Rocket Belt (The Target Access Option): Builds out of Aether Wisp + Catalyst. Stays nearly the same as now. Upon extended combat, the move speed passive is reapplied to your champ along with a small health gen, similar to Fleet Footwork.

Above changes accomplishes the following:

- Gives back a Rod Of Ages like effect sustain component. Kind of like AP Phage.
- Catalyst No longer restricted to mana champs,
- Gives some mana to mana-based mages if they buy these items.
- Modal effect on Night Harvester and Rocket Belt makes them better for sustained combat battle mages.
- Makes sense finally that all 3 mana-less mage mythics give health
- All builds have flavor in their components (maintain stats upon combine).
- Mirrors options that AD Fighters have right now (Stridebreaker, GoreDrinker).

That's because he can rush bramble vest + seeker's + plated steelcaps and be incredibly hard to kill early. Now that seeker's will no longer be an essential rush item, should Morde finally get a compensation buff to armor?  
Oh and AD assassins will probably need to be nerfed too because 15 less armor for mages early (most of which are struggling already) = death.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/m1ibul)<|endoftext|>I was theory crafting during my spare time and I came with this idea of Mordekaiser with Gargoyle stoneplate as his second item.
Since mordekaiser gets most of his stats through Riftmaker(which gives most of the AP that he will get with the exception of few not necessarily core items and all his lifesteal,minus the runes), making this as a second item sounds like a good idea, he gains a lot of tanks stats with will help him not only in laning phase(if he gets the item because he's fed ), but also on the early team fights after the laning phase, because he would be able to just throw himself in the middle of the enemy team because of his passive, the lifesteal of Riftmaker, his ult and the active of the item which will give him a pretty big shield that when paired with his W would be annoying to deal with.
The only downsight I can see is the size of the shield that wouldn't be that big early on,  however i still think this could be viable.
What are your thoughts on this?<|endoftext|>Just wanted to share my progress!

I'm a Gold jungle main (Mundo'd my way to Gold for the first time since S2) who was looking for a cool toplane pick. After watching many VOD's on youtube I had to try him out.

Is there an educational Morde or top streamer you could recommend to learn more about our guy?

Sometimes I don't know what to build, what is your core or go to build? Is Cosmic Drive viable?

Early on he can poke you stupidly hard with his knock up, and if you pull him he just knocks you up and walks away. Then around level 4 or 5 he can poke you down and then do 500 damage in 2.5s with 2.5s of cc and you can't do anything due to being knocked up and silenced. Then after that he can just run you down with a knock up into everfrost into silence into 400 true damage execute, not to mention how quick he is and how easily he can sidestep your e.

I started my  "addiction" in Season 10 and began to play ranked. First i spammed MF. After being in B1 for a long time without any hope to climb i got better with her all the way to Silver 1. But i hated adc having a support and decided to main my second best role Top. I also left because i only played mf. This was when S11 began. I started in B1 with jax had some success to around s3 i think. Then i mained Morde. Dunno why and how but i liked him and i got s1 again fairly fast. Now i am stuck between s1 and s2. Sometimes i get to s1 70 lp sometimes i get demoted to s2. My summonername is DracheDragooon (EUW). 
My questions:
Is Morde a good champion to main? Should i leave him and return to jax? (I liked him but my splitpush was / maybe still is not very good) or maybe trie Kayle (played her some normals "smurfing" but she is not a frontliner and i do not like playing so passive. So what do i do wrong? Is my cs bad? My Morde ults or do i loose to many 1 vs 1 fights top? Is Morde the wrong pick or is this just were i belong? Maybe my build is wrong. So many things and i have no clue. 
My last 3 games i lost. In the first one i got an S and the third one S-. I trie to not flame / type much and also only play morde in ranked ( tried Kayle in like 3 ranked games that does not count).

Personally I would choose Rylais over the other two but I'm open to discussion.<|endoftext|>I recently thought of a change that could add some mechanical depth to Morde involving his W.

Currently, the W is the most basic part of Morde's kit, with a pointless heal and level up scaling, since it's basically pointless to level it up.

My idea:
Active: Create a barrier for x seconds that absorbs charge equal to the z% damage that take and y% of the damage you deal. After x seconds or recast, gain a shield equal to the charge.

Level Up: Increase X, Z, Y

This will force players to use W when they will be receiving and dealing the most damage rather than passively gaining charge.

Side Note: I was think that the barrier could reduce you damage taken while it's active in exchange for not charging with damage taken, however, I wasn't sure about this and how the damage reduction would scale.<|endoftext|>It is so fun playing Mord with this item, bonking constantly is amazing. If anyone didnt played with that item yet give it a try<|endoftext|>Every time i fight ww no matter the anti life steal items i build i lose. How do you guys deal with him in top lane?(plz i need this for my sanity)<|endoftext|>

https://reddit.com/link/ltoxyg/video/qypsre7231k61/player<|endoftext|>So. I've heard they wanted to make his W interact with his passive. Totally understandable since his W is somewhat underwhealming. A simple shield and the second part of it is almost never used in realistic fight scenarios outside of lanephase trading. Heres my simple suggestion. 

Base stats:
Increase his Armor and MR slightly lategame. 

Why does Nami have more base armor than Mordekaiser? SHES A FISH!

Passive:

New: 
Any bonus shields Mordekaiser gains ( which means outside of his W  ) are 15% stronger. Maybe give it a scaling like 5% / 10% / 15% i dunno. 

W: 

Removed: W  %shield heal at reactivation.

New: 

At Activation of Mordekaisers' Shield he passivly builds up a second bar based on how much damage his passive did over the time of Mordekaiser being shielded. 
Mordekaisers passive explodes in an AOE around him when shield is either destroyed or at reactivation of his W. Damage of said explosion based on how much damage the passive did while charging in his W shield.

As for the explosions attributes.. maybe it should slow or shred resistances or deal %health dmg.  

Mordekaiser will have to build up his passive again in order to be able to activate his W AOE burst again. 

So basically burst his W shield down and his explosion barely does damage. When fighting Mordekaiser you would have to strategically save up your most damaging abilities for when he shields himself if you dont want to get hurt. His passive only builds up the damage bar while his W shield is active. Shields from outside sources don't prolong the damage build up of his passive. But keeping his Shield alive through other shields of course works for example by Stoneplate or Janna E. His W shield still decays so it has a natural damage cap. 

R: 

Ult uncleansable by qss or any true cleanse like Rengar W or GP W at 16. It can ofc still get canceled at the channel of R. -> A nice powerspike because leaving Mordekaiser with 3 abilities isn't fun and logically as he gets stronger such foolish tricks of those filthy mortals won't work anymore.

My thoughts on this. 

With those changes I tried to make Mordekaisers kit deeper especially his W and Passive. I also tried to make him excell even more at long term trades and make him an even stronger tank buster. I also wanted to shift his power from healing to shielding. In League there are alot of insanely healing champions. Having a fighter champion in League with insane sustain from shields instead of healing outside from support champions would give LoL more variaty. And an existing counter just like GW to healing exists aswell and It's getting buffed aswell. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.<|endoftext|>I have been recently watching Tyler1 and Hashinshin and they both brought up some build that consisted of seekers tabs bramble and Hash said it’s busted, what is this so called build and what’s it’s use<|endoftext|>Mordekaiser<|endoftext|>i dont know how much of you play legends of runaterra right now, but it just got a new expansion with shurima. there are currently 55 champions in the game. there are 154 champs currently in lol.

Now I'm a Low Elo player and new to league. Recently just got into Bronze after a massive win streak today. Now I'm wondering what people build?

I currently Start Dark Seal AND refillable potion and Aggressively Lane and try 6 as quick as possible.

At 6 depending on my Matchups I'll Get Boots (Usually for AD Resist or Tenacity.) Or just get a Large rod.

I build Rabadons as my First item. Then Riftmaker (Exploring Hextech belt possibility, Due to selling Boots in the late game for more AP.) Then Nashor tooth and Lichbane. After that it's whatever I feel. Might be Morelonomicon, Ryllais Scepter or even cosmic drive.

I'm finding Nashor tooth and Lichbane very Powerful items at the moment. Especially Lichbane which I see very few people use.

If at any point during the build I max out my Dark Seal stacks I do buy Mejai's Soulstealer. Which is essential buy to me as an item even if I'm not leading. As if I Cautious duel in my Death realm I can gather stacks regardless. Even trading 2 Kills in Team fights/ Assists works.

What have other people been building? I've won A lot of matches recently. Nearly 80% Of them (If I'm right.) And wondered what others thought of this and are building.

Also got my first Pentakill today.<|endoftext|>I mean his AA with lethal tempo and crit chance do so much damage compared to mine. My abilities with their cooldown cannot kill him in time especially when he has his ulti. I can or may be able to kill him easily if doesn't have  his R. But other than that no way. I can't also escape easily since he can catch up with me with his W and E. But every time i have him in lane i lose it no matter what. Like last game my lane was pushed to the nexus with trynda all by himself.<|endoftext|>I haven't touched this champion since the riftmaker nerfs, but now I feel like he is not bad. The new cosmic drive seems quite good with the AH and MS which are both invaluable stats. I could see morde rise as a more prevalent counterpick to AD bruisers by building BTS in lane and then cucking them with CDR. Having low cd q/e and movement speed from cosmic drive can makes him feel a lot less kitable. What do you guys think?<|endoftext|>In terms of clear speed, clear health, ganks, and then maybe dueling/counterjungling. 



Can he do it?<|endoftext|>

Meaning his ult stacks for every champ killed in his ult, but instead of stacking health it gives ad and ap stacks but it would stack like senna but replace crit and range for ap and add a little less than sennas pasive.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/lrvcx8)<|endoftext|>Sooo, I know that W and passive should be swapping, and that may have been promised even a pet and the old ult (even tho with very small chances), and I know it has been said that will happen after Mundo's rework... Munod's rework should be a thing for the next month so... WHERE IS MORDE RIIIII RIIII.  
Lmao ok joking aside, do we have any news?<|endoftext|>He supposedly received buffs in the Patch 10.4 that "should" enable him to be played in the jungle, but not even Mobalytics has data on Jg Mordekaiser in the current patch, so i decided to consult Mordekaiser Mains here on Reddit

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/lrjkye)<|endoftext|>The first MOBA I ever played was HOTS. This was back in the Overwatch days when Blizzard ran a crossover event. Compared to LOL, HOTS is way less complicated and way less punishing. It's harder to 1v9 carry but easier to get carried, which makes it a good entry into the genre.

When I transitioned to LOL, years later, Mordekaiser was one of the champions that I grew to rely on as a simple champ to learn the complexities of the game with. While I did eventually drop him, he holds a special place in my heart for that reason. However, there are complaints about Mordekaiser after his rework.  A lot of the skill expression was shaved from his kit (such as having AP or AD builds), and his former role as a priority target nuker has seemingly been given to Viego instead. He also had the problem of few AP Bruiser items, now solved by the season 11 items, and still has the issue of low in-lane sustain given how weak his W is. His W is also just a less interactive version of Sett's W, and his ultimate doesn't really make sense for a juggernaut, as his weaknesses are only exacerbated when playing against anyone who can kite him in the death realm.

While Mordekaiser's lore and thematic are amazing, his gameplay doesn't reflect them. He doesn't feel like the master of life and death, he feels like a generic evil magic knight.

So what would a rework attempt to fix? In order of priority:

1. Make his ultimate fit better into Morde's kit, or scrap it.
2. Replace his W with better in-lane sustain
3. Give more skill expression
4. Ideally make his gameplay better fit his lore

Enter stage left: [Leoric, The Skeleton King](https://youtu.be/rGVYgvRkBBA).

Leoric is a lane bully bruiser who specializes in area control, sustain, and percent health damage, but suffers against mobile targets who can stay out of his effective range, very similar to Mordekaiser.

His Q is very similar to Mordekaiser's, being a cleave which slows enemies, that is typically built to be his main waveclear tool. His E is a mobility tool similar to a reverse Yone E, where his body is left behind while the untargetable spirit goes ahead, before the body snaps forward to the spirit's position. While this is a fine abilities, I think Mordekaiser's Q and E are fit for purpose and I won't be touching them.

The interesting parts are his passive and W. Leoric's W is a projectile which if it hits a champion, forms a tether that drains them for up to 20% max health over 4 seconds, and heals Leoric for 20% of *his* max health over the same duration. Leoric is slowed by 20%. Both effects end early if the tether is broken. His Passive is the real point of all this: When Leoric dies, he continues to roam the battlefield in a reduced state, specifically **he cannot do any damage**, but he can still move, recall, apply slows with Q, and heal himself, which we will get back to. This is called a Zombie effect in LOL, which is currently held by Sion, Kog'Maw and and Karthus. Aside from providing vision while dead, the main asset to this passive is that Leoric can use his W to heal himself, reducing his death timer, and choose his spawn location.

There are three additional factors I would like to introduce here: one is that Mordekaiser would not be able to buy items unless he recalls while dead, two is that he should get a flat, non-scaling penalty to his respawn timer (eg 20 seconds) to reduce early game cheese, and third is his ultimate. Specifically I would want Mordekaiser to be able to cast his ult while dead. Here is how it would work:

While Mordekaiser is dead, he is regenerating health such that his respawn timer is how long it will take him to heal to full. He is unaffected by external healing sources such as the item shop or allied healing, but his own healing from W does apply, reducing his death timer. If Mordekaiser is dead and ults someone, then he fights with the amount of health he has regenerated so far. If he wins the duel, instead of stealing stats he is restored to full health and respawns. If he loses the duel, his opponent gets kill gold again, making the ult a very risk/reward option. Morde also has a really long cooldown on his ult , so losing it really sucks for him.

This might seem cheese at first, since he could die and then immediately ult someone to kill them, but that's no different to dying to a Sion, Karthus or Kog'Maw zombie, except you are fully capable of killing Morde again if he doesn't wait for his regen. For reference, at level 6 he would have (16 base plus 20) 36 seconds to get to full health if you dodge his W, and even 10 seconds is enough time to get under tower and recall or at least be protected from his ultimate since the tower would 1-shot him. However, if this proves to be a problem then you could just block him from using his ult for the flat respawn timer penalty.

Lastly would be to add some conversions into his ultimate. AD into AP, armour pen into magic pen, maybe attack speed into ability haste? Also QSS and unstoppability removing you from the death realm isn't cool. This could be tweaked into a longer channel (only a little bit, like 1 or 0.8 seconds or so) that can be interrupted by unstoppability, dashing away, or by silencing/stunning Morde.

In summary:

1. Leave Mordekaiser Q and E untouched
2. Replace his W and Passive to make him more of an unkillable king of death
3. Tweak his ultimate to interact with new passive and make it more interactive
4. Maintain his weaknesses as juggernaut by leaving him vulnerable to dashes and CC<|endoftext|>Last season mord used to rush bramble and seekers in alot of matchups but now if i don't go for a mythic rush the enemy laner will have mythic and i dont so i lose the  1 vs 1 or i wont have damage to kill . So what to do  if i need armor or bramble do i rush them or no ? Thanks.<|endoftext|>After riftmaker and cosmic drive which one would u make. Lich is spicy for the damage and movement speed, but is it worth losing the 350 hp from demonic?<|endoftext|>Since he's not doing very well currently I thought about a way to make him more powerful just for fun. So I thought about giving his ult a passive where everytime he dealt magic damage to champions, it marks them. The mark may or may not have a dot (like the old ult but obviously scaled down) and morde can only use his ult on marked targets. In exchange death realm can't be cleansed in any way, this way morde can't just flash in a fight and abduct someone, instead he actually needs to get close and hit first before abducting. Oh and the ult passive only works when it's off cd and the dot could be something like 4% max hp magic dmg<|endoftext|>Because it will probably not affect his win rate since its a letality item it will mostly be built on assassins BUT as soon as anyone gets it it will feel like shit beacause all your survivability is gonna br cippled to hell and the shields that you can get off without them getting the 50% reduction are gonna be destroyed instantly since that bullshit item will also halve existing shields<|endoftext|>I am not a main, just played a few games with riftmaker and thought about it. Compared to it u lose 50hp ( barely noticeable i suppose), the omnivamp and true damage part. U gain 5 ability haste and it.s mythic passive gives 15 AP per completed item instead of 8. U also waste the mana. 

Another considerable point would be that leaching rod is a away more powerful part of mythic than anything build into everfrost.

However, would u consider the root / slow worth it in any situation?<|endoftext|>It's made by me yes. Does this count as heavily edited? If not i'm sorry and will understand why it was removed

It's so obvious riot abandoned Old Mordekaiser and didn't try to work with him because he just wasn't appealing to the public, he didn't make you feel like a shounen anime hot protagonist, neither a cute faerie-like girl with one thousand range.  


Mordekaiser had so many bugs Naerlyn wrote a book about <most of> his bugs, and none of them were addressed. It's in your face they had no love for the champion, he didn't make Riot enough profit and his appearance wasn't monetizable.   


The game just changed so much from back then. Back in the day League looked like a Fantasy RPG/DND-like with clear champion stereotypes.  


Now what we have is Riot August working his fingers to the bone to fix all Viego's passive bugs because Viego is worth it, hot boy with a visible 6-pack and emo clothing. I have anything against Viego design, not to mention I think it was clever of Riot to release him this way (could've been better tho) because that broke many expectations of a second Mordekaiser-like champion, or a Lich King.<|endoftext|>

So good I didn't wanna wake up. For some reason, my dream self gave Morde these buffs:

Morde Passive (Addition to previous passive): Morde passively converts a percentage of AD gained per level to bonus AP.

Q - Also Slows isolated enemies hit

W - Morde also passively gains Amour and Magic resistance per level (WTF. He was Garen. It was awesome.)

E - Also Deals more damage to isolated enemies, additionally slows them as well.

R - \*New\* Morde gains increased health regen- (I think my dream self meant lifesteal, but I'm unsure) while in his ult, increases health gained per rank up of R along with CDR.

Recast: consume 50% shield -> health and stop converting health into shield (still keep the lifesteal until 5s if recast early)

old w:stacking shield before activate;

new w: stacking more shield after active( basically lifesteal but shield instead of heal);

I've playing Mordekaiser since I started playing League and Darius used to beat me in lane a lot, but in this current patch I feel that Darius is so weak in a lot of aspects against Mordekaiser. Mordekaiser became a counter pick to Darius for me because: if darius ults, you can tank all the damage with you W, if he tries to engage or keep the trade longer with his E, you can reserve E him to desengage and if you freeze the lane in your tower, Darius is just a 300 gold bag.

*viable*

On PBE Everfrost got changed to include Kindlegem in its Buildpath, got a 25(%5 AP) damage buff and has 50 more Health when completed.

What does this change for Mordekaiser ?

1. Everfrost's buildpath was garbage for Mordekaiser. 2150 Gold for 80AP and 10 Ability Haste, then you had to wait 1250 more Gold to finish it.

Now you can instead priotirize Kindlegem, Blasting Wand and Amplifying Tomes giving you 80AP, 10 Ability Haste and 200 Health.

2. Everfrost complements Mordekaiser's kit well when completed. The Active can be used alongside your Q, W, E and R.

For Q, E and R you can Everfrost and immediatly press Q/E/R to use Everfrost during your Q/E/R cast. You can also use W when casting Everfrost.

This means an almost guarenteed Q/E or a rooted target for your R which you can followup with E. Even if you can't land the Root it slows them by %65 for 1.5s, and not to mention your R Cast slows your target already so the Root should be easy to land.

3. Everfrost is %86.5 Gold Efficient without its Mana, and %134.5 Gold Efficient at 5 items. Gold Value wise its almost 80 Gold down Riftmaker at 4 items.

Main attraction here is value from its Active. Mordekaiser has some of the easiest abilities to dodge, guaranteeing a Q/E hit or having a Target rooted for R is massive.

Sure, late game full build you have a whopping 1% more Omni than we used to get but how often do we get there nowadays? And with the weaker early game I’ve been testing out doing tank mythics into Demonic embrace into rylais and going for more of a durable tank that does lots of afk dps using the Burn/1.2% from the Demonic embrace. I’ve been doing Chemtank or Sunfire->Demonic->rylais and the rest based on the game. If the enemy has lots of healing early I’ll get oblivion orb, and finish morello later since it’s 60% reduction is easier to proc over Thornmail(needs to immobilize to make it 60%). I have felt way better in lane/team fights with how long I last and when I get that max W shield it takes them so long to break cause of my resistances etc. also I’m skipping domination (although I want to experiment with Ravenous Hunter using tank) and doing resolve with conditioning/revitalize for the extra heal/shield strength.<|endoftext|>Was thinking how they could make AP Bruiser items without them getting poached by mages and this Is what i came up with.

Shard of the Black Stone 

Cost : 3000 gold

50 AP 

400 HP 

PASSIVE : 10% Self Heal and Shield Power
PASSIVE : After hitting an enemy champion with an auto attack gain 2.5 AP per second in combat stacks up to 10 times decays after 5 seconds out of combat

I think something along these lines could make AP Bruiser items that arent very appealing to mages and Assassins.


Why ? The AP Is low for a mage and the passive only starts stacking after auto attacking, something that Morde, Diana, Sylas Galio and company do as part of their basic gameplay pattern but that mages have to actively incorporate in their combo wich both, delays their burst and even after it starts stacking is not gonna bring them too much use unless the fight goes on for way too long given that It takes a while to come online.

I think this Is the only way they can make AP Bruiser items, by making them items that require active combat and time to get going.

Let me know what your think about this.<|endoftext|>

I made a post today about how Mord sucks so hard so I jumped into the new patch played 4 games of standard Mord and they weren't great, even the ones I won they felt bad because I get blasted. Then I tried playing tank for 2 games and these are the results of both games. Most damage, most taken, most self mitigated. S+

I am defeneatly going to play Mord as a tank, it feels amazing, if I get hit by a single stun or keep being perma slowed by something as a bruiser Mord I won't survive long or I will get 1 shot, but with Tank I got chain cc-ed I soaked everything and actully killed them, no longer do I have to worry if someone escapes. They will fight me because I am a tank and underestimate me or if they leave, eeeh, im a tank I don't care really. I am an actual CHAD frontliner it's insane. I love it. If anyone wants to copy the build and runes feel free. Thank god I can keep playing our king! :D

Passive: Mordekaiser shields himself for 25%(+1% per 100 ap) dmg dealt Vs champions (reduced to 12.5%(+0.5% per 100 ap) Vs minions-not monsters) up to a max of 25%(+1% per 100 ap) of his max hp
Q: Passive: Mordekaiser deals 40% of his ap and 15% of his bonus ad as bonus magic on hit DMG
Active: Add a 30% bonus ad scaling
W: Passive: After hitting a champion or large monster 3 times Mordekaiser gains Darkness Rise: Mordekaiser deals 10/15/20/25/30(+25% ap) and 1/2/3/4/5%(+1 % per 100 ap) enemy max hp as magic dmg per second and gains movement speed(I don't know what numbers to put here)
Active: If Mordekaiser has Darkness Rise up he shatters all the armour he gained from his passive dealing it as magic dmg and healing for 50/40/30/20/15% dealt depending on the amount of enemy champions hit (The heal only works Vs champions and Darkness Rise ends instantly once W is cast)
As a result of this rework mord would have to lose quite a bit of base dmg on and maybe even the level scaling<|endoftext|>This might sound like rant but I really do mean what I say.

I never tought I would say this, I love Mord so much but im just sick of him, I can't be fcked anymore, his lack of mobility compared to other juggernauts like Garen, Skarner and Darius is insane, and it really doesn't feel like you get rewarded in late game too, you just get 1 shot as a fcking juggernaut. You are suposed to be this huge fortress and if someone is close to you, you still don't get rewarded because everyone is so stupidly mobile. Even tanks have dashes like HELLO!! I just can't stand how stupid it feels. Me (as Mord) Anivia and Morgana 1v3ed a not even fed Yone. I had Armor and healing reduction with thornmail and Anivia had oblivion orb. Noone could do shit because executioners doesn't matter, he heals through everything and is so mobile it's disgusting. Mord is already imobile and even if you get hit by a single cc (even if you have tenacity) it simply doesn't matter. Long cooldowns, you need extended fights and you simply can't have that in Season 11. I really don't even know what to say anymore, I will always love Mord more then any champ but I simply can't be bothered to play him anymore I can just keep naming things that are bad about him. I was excited for all the nerfs to bruisers and buffs to Mord and Riftmaker but I really don't think it will matter at all. I wish you guys all the best and that you will enjoy Mord more then I do now. Please if you have anything to say that could help me to not leave Mord or what makes you to keep playing him tell me in the comments. I will read every single one.<|endoftext|>Hello, I have quit the league after mordekaiser rework announcement because I was otp and I wonder is there any similar character to the old mordekaiser?<|endoftext|>Imagine how dope it would be if my man had a legendary skin from the battle boss, blood moon or other skin lines<|endoftext|>I've been on this subreddit a few times now, and despite his current state in the meta... Or just being viable at all really... I like Mordekaiser. However, despite this sub being made for a community of people who feel the same, I get really mixed signals.

I get that Morde right now is pretty terrible, and in need of some serious buffs, and some of the frustration I read in comments, threads and posts may be because of that... But I find a lot of people like going on about how un-fun, generic and just overall worse Morde is compared to his older version. I'm not saying that he isn't, I didn't play him then so I wouldn't know, but I really like the re work, despite its flaws. I thought this sub would be full of people who did too...


I just wanted to know how you guys think of Morde In general, do you hate him? Love him? Only stick around because you used to love him, and you can't move on entirely? Like I said, you guys, despite being a part of a community of Morde enthusiasts, seems like you have a very love/hate relationship with him.  the things I hear from other people really make me feel like I'm wrong for liking his re work, or playing him in general.

So yeah, I'm just confused and wanted to know how you guys really feel about Morde.<|endoftext|>Greetings community, a question that I have been thinking is the type of champion that Mordekaiser is, he is a juggernaut but unlike most he is a short-range magician, thanks to his characteristics he can endure and at the same time he can do large amounts of damage , but my question is the following: He is a fighter more than a magician, the items for him are only accessible if they have some AP or life, but beyond that he needs 3 Items almost to get what the AD fighters in a only item get. Look at the case of stridebreaker: attack speed, AD, health, and CDR or whatever you say xd, apart from giving immobile champions a dash and additional slow movement speed as a mythical passive.

Bit despite having The Riftmaker, to obtain that I would need 2 more Items to get these benefits. Riot really have precent mind that there are short-range Magicians champions, or it is simply always to arm a lot of damage to AP and then try to reach the enemy that if it is faster or move if you miss the E only your R remains and 7 seconds they fall short to which many mobile champions can do. Greetings and I just wanted to leave my opinion.<|endoftext|>I've largely stopped playing morde in season 11 after the first set of riftmaker nerfs. With haunting guise gone, and his preferred mythic being only passable post-nerf; his early game just isn't worth the pay-off anymore. Even through skilled outplay, winning fights that you generally shouldn't; what's the reward? Barely being able to 1v1 mid game junglers going even? It's ridiculous. His kit is so obviously set up to be an all in 1v1 champion, look no further than his ult and isolation damage on his q. Yet, riot keeps pushing him in the direction of a poke oriented skirmisher. It's almost like they realized they gutted him (and so many other ap bruisers) by removing haunting guises and its ramping damage passive; and are now trying to cover up the mistake by completely changing his playstyle. When I saw morde buffs in the patch notes, I was ecstatic. I was hoping for something to bump up his drawn-out fight potential, perhaps a w or passive buff, something to help cover up the lack of ramping damage he has until he can finish riftmaker (since unlike liandry's, the components of riftmaker are not what mordekaiser wants to be building. haunting guise>>>>>>leeching leer). Without something like that procc'ing his passive feels almost pointless; in certain matchups, from even lane state and a health advantage, enemy top laners can just ignore your passive and still 1v1 you. Yet, riot as mentioned previously, chose to buff his E, and make a pun about it in the patch notes. They just feel so out of touch with why morde's win rate is faltering so hard this season. An E buff only serves to help him initiate fights, but whats the point if he loses them anyway?<|endoftext|>I'm not sure if you guys have seen it, but there has been a funny post on the main League subreddit about the result of Nasus's kit being translated a ton of times via Google Translate. Here is a link to the post in case you haven't seen it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/b77t6l/nasuss\_kit\_translated\_over\_12\_times\_in\_google/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/b77t6l/nasuss_kit_translated_over_12_times_in_google/)



Unfortunately from what I've seen, the guy who posted this got his Reddit account suspended for unknown reasons. So now that he's gone, I'll take it as my duty to give you guys a good laugh with the help of the flawed translating program. And now, I'll do it for the big badass villain that can take you straight into his death dimension just by pointing at ya.



The order of languages I'll be using will be the exact same that the original guy used last, which would be this (and the kit description will be from lol.gamepedia): English → Spanish → Russian → Korean → Arabic → Japanese → Chinese (Traditional) → Italian → German → Vietnamese → English → Greek → Latin → Yiddish → Hebrew → English



So without further ado, here is the result: 



**The rebirth of my iron law in fashion** 

**Dark rise** 

Will be sent immediately after the attacks of 3 or love songs, the great champions and the whales, the fruits, the magical emperor of Sicily mold damage to the environment, in frames per second (monsters increases) speed of 4% and three seconds.  

Schimmel offers Caesar's main attack (40 +%) bonus on magic damage. 



**aeration** 

All over the land of darkness they attacked the enemy strikes, making the province an active experience for the magic of the enemy, which would be magnified at once. 



**Win** 

Mordekaiser (35% / 15%) eliminates the inherent quality of the accident and the damage that can be protected.  

In Invicta offers a sign to be able to correct any changes. 

The protective coverage of the cultural level over time. A 75% reduction in this stack loss is a free and leading source.  

Minimum protection, 5% of maximum health 

The protector of the largest, in 30% of maximum health. 



**Desktop lock** 

Cons: It has a twist of magic, from Mordechai fell. 

Active, he reaps courage on the part of the enemy, Mordechai in the target area, and the loss of all property by magic. 



**The realm of death** 

Active: Mordechai, and taking the target in a dead zone for 7 seconds should behave with theft 10% of the main feature. 

When a man strikes in the camp, until the death of the emperor in most of the pattern, drag the soul and the secret store affairs that Solomon has, and the ways to achieve this goal are found.<|endoftext|>In anything related to skins or balance, Mordekaiser is treated by Riot and the community as a champion that's not played very much. However, last season he was consistently in the top 5-6 most played Top laners every single patch. This season too, by no means is he a "niche" champion.

So why does Riot act like he is an uncommon champion? Like in the skin roadmap thing or whatever, he was grouped in with "low playrate champs who need skins".<|endoftext|>Whenever I'm against an Illaoi I always seem to get bodied, I can usually overpower her in the cum zone cause there are no tentacles there but other than that I won't be able to farm and she always get ahead of me<|endoftext|>Medium good News!

Then riot gave vladimir a mini-rework so his Q dealt less damage normally but his empowered Q did more damage than his fully charged E.

I propose a similar thing to mordekaiser Q.

Something like  
"Every 7/6/5/4/3 casts Mordekaiser's Q deals X% of AP + X% total AD + X%max health bonus magic damage"

but as a cost Mordekaiser's Q deals less damage on regular casting. Idk the exact numbers needed to make it balanced but I think this would help morde feel more like his old self, if only a little<|endoftext|>I'm just very sad about how hard-bound Morde is to these particular item + rune setups. I had faith that the new item shop would provide at least one other Mythic and/or Rune playstyle combo that would be a legit enough contender to compete and give you something to think about. 

Best I've come up with that work fine enough

- Rocketbelt + Electrocute, single target burst. <- Big Mace.

- Night Harvester + Dark Harvest <- KS king. Do okay damage in messy teamfights to clean up. "Why didn't you just go conqueror though?" is what I always think about when I do this. Also practically always requires an initiation champ on your team since you have none yourself. 

- Grasp + Tank . I can lockdown one person and not die unless they are ahead. Pretty miserable beyond that. Same utility can be achieved just by building Zhonya's in a regular build...


I wish Mordekaiser's abilities had more clear plug ins into other damage/tank/sustain/utility playstyles. Right now its all about being a drain tank. I wish they gave him off meta scaling stats similar to how they made AP Twitch more viable thing this last season.<|endoftext|>1. When Mordekaiser ults Sion in his Q channel, in Death Realm, Q wont knock up. Not sure if it even deals damage.

2. When Tahm Kench eats Mordekaiser right as Mordekaiser ults him, Death Realm bugs out an appears smaller. Approximately the size of nexus.

3. When Mordekaiser ults Janna right as she does the knockback will push Mordekaiser beyond the borders of Death Realm. He can still walk back inside tho. 

Especially the Sion one is a bug that has to be fixed soon. Poor boy Sion lost because of it. 

Feel free to tell me if any of you have experienced similar bugs or even other ones below.<|endoftext|>Let's see, it's just an idea, it doesn't necessarily have to be all in a mini rework, bite is a shampoo that is generally weak, although it is true if it had a little more sustain, not damage, but something that heals this bite It would be much better even if his abilities are easy to dodge it does not mean that his kit is decent, he really lacks healing and if you ask me for some stamina xd.



These ideas came to mind, it is not necessary that everything be in the same mini rework, since it would not be mini to put so many changes, but maybe take some.



the w would be the one that most really ask xd, that the shield becomes a passive, and the aura becomes the w, and that the aura does not matter that it does little damage, but that the aura for example absorbs each minions 10% of life for example, and that in each champion is supcion of life of 15% to tell them something, and the old shield becomes passive in case you hit any skill with bite, a small shield comes out, but that comes out even if it is xD, I mean we have sustain, and you don't take away the essence of the original rework that you wanted to give it since everything is still there but with changes.



The R if I doubt that they will change something since more than mini rework is a rework of 50% of the champ so that I doubt they will do it if they do it would be super rare (which I return and repeat I doubt) but maybe mini rework in the future That the R is the same and you have 10% of stolen statistics and everything but, if you kill in the kingdom, you permanently stay 5% of the enemy's statistics and that can be done infinitely, that is, the R of bite is lazy and the truth does not give a good feeling once you kill you keep the statistics but until there, and that would also give a very strong beat to bite because imagine killing in the R 5 times, you would have 25% of stolen statistics, although It is op, it would give more motivation to play morde in late but that will be left to riot if you want to do something like that, what do you think?<|endoftext|> This Friday at 3 P.M. EST I will be streaming the second ever Mordekaiser mains podcast! We will be joined by u/MahmoudIbnZubair and u/Quevlar as the moderators of the show.

 The allotted times are just a rough estimate on how much we want to talk about that certain question, it will most likely take longer since we have a good amount of people. Topics are subject to change, but this is what the general discussion will be about. 

 This will all be streamed on my twitch channel [https://www.twitch.tv/kaizermordelol](https://www.twitch.tv/kaizermordelol) 

Stay tuned!<|endoftext|>Yeah it's all in the image here but let me give a brief rundown. Conq isn't the ideal Morde keystone it was in s10. I only ever use it against tanky teams where I know I'll have it maxed longer than I'm stacking it. 6 hits just to max it out is barely enough time to see it through, and the secondary runes are arguably better than precision. Let me run it down step by step.

Grasp: Makes for better short trades, and fights against squishy champs. That grasp whack in the late game with 3k health ends up doing 120 magic damage a proc, enough to make Wits End look weak. I generally end up getting similar heal numbers from this rune and Conq. The difference being that Grasp is better in lane as you can easily proc it and get out. I'm not going to claim that the damage is higher than Conq because we simply aren't given the value of how much damage Conq gives us, only its heal value, but it gives your autos a ton of extra punch. Also the bonus 5 hp adds up over time.

Demolish: Yeah I chose this over Shield Bash but both are good. I tend to bring my shield up late into fights, and given that W is your last maxed ability, you don't actually get to use that shield very often. Demolish can give you plate gold and make you a splitpush nightmare and I value that over a tiny bump up in damage that I sometimes don't get to use. I'll mention that Shield Bash does work in conjunction with Gargoyle Stoneplate for an absolutely MASSIVE amount of damage, but even in the cases where the game goes on long enough for it to be a 4th-5th item option, it's not a guarantee purchase.

Second Wind: Hardest choice to make on the rune setup and I'd say the other options are still good choices into some games. If you think your gonna stomp laning phase go for conditioning by all means, and if you're fighting something like Renekton that dumps all their damage up front, Bone Plating isn't bad either. But I chose Second Wind because of how much value it provides in both lane and longer teamfights. Morde does exceptionally well in longer fights and if you're not up against a hyper burst heavy team it's common to see this rune give you 2K+ heals in one game. It heals through dots, Zhonyas, shields and death realms.

Revitalize: Kinda obvious but I won't say Overgrowth hasn't crossed my mind. Free HP is nice but Revitalize is too good to pass up. Morde heals a lot, Morde Shields a fair bit, increasing these values is never a bad thing. In longer games, Revitalize gives me heals comparable to keystone runes, especially if I went Riftmaker. This rune synergizes with Visage and Stoneplate (Though Overgrowth also scales your Stoneplate Shield by a similar amount). Remember to use your shield AFTER dropping to low HP in a fight so this rune makes the shield larger.

Ravenous and Taste of Blood are not worth debating. I've yet to meet a Morde who doesn't grab that free omniheal and top tier lane sustain. MAYBE go eyeball collection over ToB if you miss the free AP Conqueror gives you and you plan on roaming a fair bit to stack it quickly.

Being able to have your own drake as a siege monster was the best. Elder drake was game ending by itself. Having a 4th shot Jhin or a rapidfire Cait was hilarious. Hell, even a Warwick ghost was fun to let him run his own team down. Kinda makes me wish defeating someone in death realm rewarded a ghost, rather than 10% stat steal on cast. I miss my 80% win rate Morde. Gone but never forgotten<|endoftext|>First S+ with Mordekaiser during this game after trying him out. I think I'm gonna be on this subreddit a lot more :)

Q: Untouched

W:   
 \---- W2 is no more, W shield amount -20%    
\++++ W cd starts when the ability is pressed, kills/assist reset W cd 

E:   
\--- no longer does damage

\++ gains 2/4/6/8/10% magic vamp  


R: 

\--- realm size +50%  
\++ can no longer be QSSd

Optional R change:

\--- no longer steals stats  
\++ ghosts ( any kind, don't think about old ghosts )



Brief explanation:

W: Mord is thematically unkillable, so you should play with your shield more. Nerfs are to balance out the buffs.

E:  Mord is thematically unkillable, it's absolutely not plausible that he doesn't have built-in sustain. Nerfs are to balance out the buffs.

R: You know 2 things that suck at the exact same level? Having to waste 1300g and having our ult getting QSS'd. Unfun mechanic for both you and the enemy. Give enemy more room to run and remove QSS interaction. Ult is still useful to remove other enemies from the equation. 

Optional R: Quit playing mord if you need an explanation for those.<|endoftext|>Mordekaiser should have the highest damage ability in the game hands down. Have you seen the size of his mace?!

I'd like to propose a way of bringing back the BIG Bonk while *maybe* fixing its biggest issue in the previous iteration (think Morde rework #1 with exponential scaling on Q).

**Big Issue:** Players could stack up his Q on some minions then flash in and cheat out a MASSIVE Q BONK. This oversight eventually got Mordekaiser's Q changed to the less satisfying 1-1-2 scaling. If the bonk is supposed to come back, it should require Morde to engage the enemy for a bit and build up to the BIG BOOTY BONKER.

**Less Big, but still kinda Big Issue:** If Morde is truly going to have such a monstrous Q that it BLASTS the weeb skins right off of half of the champion roster, then it should take longer to build up than three autos. Auto attacks can be cheated out faster by various items/runes in a couple seconds. There has to be some kind of CD gate that gives enemies time to recognize their demise before they get annihilated.

**Proposal:** Mordekaiser gets his exponential scaling back but under the condition that each of the previous attacks were made against the same target. In addition, there is a CD between each attack that subsequently ramps up the damage. Oh, and since there is so much counter play baked-in, the potential damage is even *higher* than the old version.



# Q: Raising Destruction

Mordekaiser empowers his next basic attack which deals bonus physical and magic damage and applies *Curse: Visions of Chaos* to his foe for 8 seconds.

The next empowered attack against an enemy with *Curse: Visions of Chaos* will deal (2-3) times the bonus damage of the first and will apply *Curse: Glimpse of Oblivion* to his foe for 8 seconds.

The next empowered attack against an enemy with *Curse: Glimpse of Oblivion* will deal (4-9) times the bonus damage of the first and will consume all Curses.

**DMG:** (10-40 \^lvl) (+45% bonus AD) physical damage + (10-40 \^lvl) (+30% AP) magic damage

**CD:** 5

**Second Attack multiplier:** 2 / 2.25 / 2.5 / 2.75 / 3

**Third Attack multiplier:** 4 / 5 / 6.25 / 7.5 / 9





**Closing Comments:** Okay so maybe this ability is a bit extreme. At level 9 and above the final bonk has a 405% bonus AD ratio and a 270% AP ratio and maybe that would be a nightmare to balance and perhaps 720 base damage at level 18 is too much. But this is just for fun after all and I'd love to hear what you guys think. Also if it wasn't obvious before, I'm not a Morde main I just like the metal boi.<|endoftext|>passive: metallic darkness



Mordekaiser deals a percentage of magic damage on his basic attacks



mordekaiser can convert the 20% of ad obtained into ap, that is, with objects from ad, 20% of it is subtracted and converted into ap damage, and even the base damage ad base is subtracted by 10% to convert it into ap





Q: annihilation



Mordekaiser smashes into the ground at sunset, dealing magic damage to enemies hit, and an isolated target increases its damage



W: madness



passive: if mordekaiser receives damage or hurts an opponent, it will load the white bar that will serve as a shield if it reaches the maximum, this is activated when attacked by champions, the shield once activated by the enemy's damage will remain until it is withdrawn by the enemy, and can be used multiple times if charged in combat



mordekaiser activates an aura around which inflicts magic damage depending on its maximum life and scaled with ap, absorbs life from minions and increases its healing against enemy champions, you will heal depending on the damage caused to the enemy, no matter what abilities you use you will heal a 10% of the damage dealt to minions and 15% against enemy champions if they are in contact with the aura, its duration is infinite and when deactivated it goes on cooldown



E - infernal claw



passive: mordekaiser resive% magic penetration depending on level



1 active: mordekaiser makes an earthquake with his footsteps, causing slight physical damage to the enemy, which slows it down by 90%, slows down both minions and champions, once when using this ability you can automatically use the active 2 of the E



2 active: mordekaiser draws a claw from the underworld that attracts its target after using the first active, which deals magic damage to the enemy minion or champion





R: Realm of death



mordekaiser traps his enemy in the realm of death for 10 seconds, and he cannot escape with objects or spells, mordekaiser steals 5% of his general statistics and if he manages to kill his opponent he will steal 2% of statistics permanently, can steal% stats from enemies in an unlimited way



postscript, do you think these ideas we make reach the ears of riot?<|endoftext|>Hello friends (Hopefully)

Its been a while since i played Mordekaiser and i really want to know from you the current state of him

Also i want to know the carry potential for morde and How good is he in early mid to late game

Also what do you think about the upcoming buffs for him

Also please be honest with your answers 

Thanks :D<|endoftext|>Already got x2 S+ and x2 most damage done.

Looks like Demonic Embrace is just your typical trap item. You lose WAY too much damage by picking it up intead Nashor.

Go try it.

omnivamp -> boots -> nashor -> zhonya -> w/e you want<|endoftext|>

https://i.redd.it/har8r2rzt9e61.gif<|endoftext|>Since morde captures the souls what if they add his ult like some kind of health restoration mechanic, if you kill the opponent in death realm you restore your 5% / 8% / 10% missing health increased by R level<|endoftext|>Why the heck there's only 1 damaging ability in our kit? 

I want to smash stuff and hit people with necromancy undead powers not run towards people and auto them, we are no freaking tryndamere or sett, they are actually designed for that! Heck even darius is better at autoing. 

We went from 4 damaging abilities to 1 damaging ability and a passive that's automatic. Not only that but ultimate is underwhelming the way the rest of the kit is designed.

Garen: literally obliterates you to the ground and punishes you for not respecting him at low HP. Darius: opens you in freakinng half on a reset and synergizes with passive. Illaoi: you cant simply get close to that MF she'll hentai the shit out of you even 2 levels behind. Tryndamere turns INVENCIBLE. Riven synergizes with her passive and executes you. Heck, even Aatrox (sorry for your loss, brothers) transforms into a HUGE demon who empowers his AD and empowers even more his AOE healing. 

Then we have Mordekaiser. "Welcome to my home hehe, you're free to move but pleease could you please not move at all? nor CC me? nor attack me? nor use item actives? pleaseee? I am lord of death!! I am the ultimate villain!!! just please dont move or else I am facing 7 precious seconds of humilliation!!"

And I am not even going to get started on W and E. I just need to let it all out from time to time or my GUTS are going to implode. Thanks for reading.<|endoftext|>I remember that at the end of last year they were talking about a mini rework to their w that was a reliable rioter now that some time has passed it seems that they simply ignored the rework and left it like that, is it that those of riot see these forums? Does anyone know something?<|endoftext|>Hi everyone!
I recently picked up morde because he is really cool but I've been struggling with him especially when it comes to combos aside from the e q combo. So if you can tell me any tips about morde in general i'd be very thankful to all of you!<|endoftext|>I tried it in normals with my friends. It is a ton of fun and I think its just as fun as top lane. Ran Conqueror/Triumph/Tenacity/Coup De Grace. With Celerity and Waterwalking from the sorcery tree. 

I started Red Buff>Raptors>Wolves>Blue>Gromp>Gank or Scuttle.

Its genuinely fun against junglers you have the early game advantage over. Highly recommend. Thanks for all the help on my first post!!<|endoftext|>Bruisers as a whole are getting their itemization demolished and Riftmaker is getting those changes i think its the best thing riot could do before seeing how everything plays out. they have their eyes on him if he continues to underperform they will probably buff him again.<|endoftext|>

\- His AA does % health damage, this plus Bork which is what he seems to buy first do a big hurt on Healthy Morde (especially now with riftmaker giving us even MORE health)

\- His R executes based on missing health and a % of bonus AD (because why not?) so its also gonna BIG hurt Morde. 

\- His E is crazy good for avoiding R, he turns invisible almost immediately, and when I tried to use it, he managed to get 1,000 miles away in an instant. (This one is more my lack of matchup experience, but initial impressions are that his E seems super annoying to deal with).<|endoftext|>I see a lot of people on here talking about his early game being dogshit, I can understand that from levels 1-2, but at 3 he start going even in trades with most champs, I’m not in any sort of high elo but I’ve never seen an issue with his early game, even being able to compete with the likes of tryndamere.

Mordekaiser's quotes against Shadow Isles champs confirm that he is the true bearer and master of the magic of the Ruination. The Ruination is the same magic that Mordekaiser uses to bind souls to himself both on Runeterra AND in the Realm of Death. We actually don't know how Viego came back to Runeterra but my guess is that he is Mordekaiser's puppet. It makes sense - he died so he went to the Death Realm, and Mordekaiser is the ruler of the Death Realm. Then Mordekaiser saw the opportunity and took it. Viego is a wraith that spreads Mordekaiser's magic all over Runeterra. And Mordekaiser knows that he will not stop until he finds Isolde. That would explain how they both are able to control souls (though Mordekaiser can do it on a MUCH MUCH MUCH greater scale) and how the same crown appears over both of their heads and the heads of the souls they bound to their will.<|endoftext|>

New on reddit and of course I am only here cause of Mord.  
Still to this day, I am a fan of all Mord skins, well, ignoring the effects and some colors, if we do not ignore those, Mord has some really screwed up skins with many of them feeling unfinished. (I haven't seen somebody talking about these in a while so here I am)  
DISCLAIMER: These are all my personal opinions, if yours is different, it is perfectly fine.  


**Infernal Mordekaiser - 520 RP**  
The cheapest of the Mordekaiser skins, and suprisingly, one of the best.  
This skin is my second skin I got for Mord and I am liking him to this day. His partical effects are all changed, having this red/yellow/oranger color to represent this fire machine in all abilities and his weapon.  
Weapon - Changed (Both model and effects)  
**Passive - Changed**  
**Q - Changed**  
**W - Changed**  
**E - Changed**  
**R -** **Changed**  
When it comes to emotes, they are not changed at all, I am fine with the Joke emote but kinda dissapointed with the guitar, it just looks weird how that small little guitar has the green effects, kinda ruining the look. The backing isn't changed too.  


**King of Clubs Mordekaiser - 750 RP**  
Definetly without a doubt the most dissapointing skin. When it comes to the old Mord, the King of Clubs was a pretty good skin for what it brought. When it comes to the model, he is beautiful, looking like a real king instead of looking like a king with a small crown that made old King of Clubs look like a true golden bucket head. The weapon model is also better, passive is very nice, W is okay but that is where the praise end, most of his effects are green which does not look good at all.  
**Passive - Changed**  
**Q - Unchanged, isn't the worst honestly**  
**W - Partially changed, there are signs of green for some reason even tough you can cleary see gold**  
**E - Unchanged**  
**R - Unchanged..**  
Everything else remains unchanged, this skin has all the potential but Riot didn't use it for him.  


**Lord Mordekaiser - 975 RP**   
Another skin that is worse than the cheapest one. Also known as Lordekaiser, it used to be a great skin for the old Mordekaiser, being very well designed, with a nice color scheme. Lord was my first skin and it isn't THAT bad, yes a lot of the effects are again, unchanged. The things that are changed are extremly good to look that in all honesty, this nice pink color fits well with the skin itself, passive is a nice pink circle with small blue pieces inside which fills it up perfectly, the green in W doesn't bother me that much, yes there is pink and would be better with only pink but as I said, not that bad, his R is weird but looks better with this skin than the clasic, his only emote changed was the guitar emote, welp wasn't really changed, rather the model's color.  
**Q - Unchanged**  
**W - Partially changed**  
**E - Unchanged**  
**R - Kinda changed**  
Over all, for what the skin brings, it should be less expensive, if it was, it would be a pretty good deal.  


**Pentakill Mordekaiser - 975 RP**  
I don't have that much stuff to say about this skin except for: Basiclly Infernal 2.0 with the same R and different shade of red, the mace is no longer the guitar, instead it is a pole created from 4 lower parts of the guitar axe. This is also the skin that changed the dance emote, the guitar is changed of course for the iconic Pentakill guitar, the sound effect is changed too with the addition of boomboxes, sadly no Pentakill song in play.  
**Q - Changed**  
**W - Changed**  
**E - Changed**  
**R - Changed**  
Overall, on the 975 RP Pricepoint, Penta mord is the superior skin and I reccomend him a lot. (Almost forgot to mention that he doesn't have the stupid hair he had in his skin before his rework.)  


**Dark Star Mordekaiser - 1350 RP**  
Do I really have to say anything? Dark Star is the best skin for Mordekaiser and the most worked on skin, with very well made chromas, all abilites changed, the model for the Spirit Poro and the guitar changed, even the voice, it is overall a beautiful skin.  


**Dragon Knight Mordekaiser - Used to be 520 RP, now a Legacy skin**  
A very nice skin with a beautiful model and weapon, and a passive color scheme I adore, that's all, all the other things are unchanged BUT  I am not mad with it because of the color scheme, the green doesn't look bad.  


What do you think about Mordekaiser skins and which one is your favourite?<|endoftext|>Buff illaoi

Nerf Fiora<|endoftext|>Is there an easy way for Morde to proc thornmails grevious wounds to 60%? For example does rylai or his E do it?<|endoftext|>Tought of It After seeing it in u/Skrylisix rework idea

They could make It a 2 to 1 convertion ratio so that he could get natural scaling from his levels gaining 2 AP per level since he gains 4 AD per level and making so that building AD Is not troll but cannot replaced AP Items for example building Steraks would give him 25 AP instead of 50 AD so that Is not Ideal but you can do it if you need to<|endoftext|>We all know that mords ult can be quite lack luster and basically gets out done by purchasing a single item which basically makes it worthless.

So I got a better idea, something that keeps with his theme and makes him more stronger.

New ult soul rip

Mordekaiser rips out the enemy's soul and deals true damage , if at 20% heath it instantly kills them and gives you soul stacks that give you 10 AP per champ , 5 ap per minion , 7ap for epic monsters and has 100 second at level 6 , 80 at level 11 and 60 at level 16.

Think of the run of litrally ripping your opponents soul out , not only will get more damage , now we have a gap closer.

Just imagine the fun of a mord Q smacking you like a train. 1000ap Q , dam that would be joy.

That would make that fiora shove off. Late game would actually be decent.<|endoftext|>

I think they need to buff him now or they could so a Mini rework.<|endoftext|>I don’t think his ultimate should bring towers into the arena, or at least they shouldn’t be able to shoot. His ultimate is already on a giant cool-down, requires you to have high enough health and damage to kill the enemy and enemies can escape while you cast it, why would you also allow enemies just to cower behind their turrets. It’s meant to be a fair 1v1. This probably would make Morde viable, but it would at least make him more fun. If you disagree, please leave a comment and tell me why, is it too OP or not powerful enough? Looking forward to reading your feedback :)<|endoftext|>As an idea, I've always liked the ruined king. He has a cool item, neat interactions with all the shadow isles champs, and is revered in the lore. I actually got pretty excited when I heard Viego would be joining league as a champion, and I think he's going to be really fun to play in-game. Gameplay wise.

There theres his identity as a champion. I feel like his entire identity is just morde's but with a new seal slapped on and a more marketable aesthetic. He's an evil king with death magic that wants to conquer the world. Morde fills this fantasy, and he does this much better than Viego. It really just seems like rito games found that the morde rework didnt stick so they repackaged it and sold it again, but worse quality. Color scheme, lore, voice lines, all of it just seem like morde's. They even took his damn crown.

That by itself has kinda sucks, but what really sucked was [the dev post.](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/champion-insights-viego/?utm_source=LeagueClient&utm_medium=hub&utm_campaign=viego_2021)  " “My part of Viego’s process was a bit different from the usual process. Reav3 asked me what I thought the Ruined King would look like, and I immediately said he’d pretty much be Mordekaiser’s cousin,” laughs concept art lead Gem “Lonewingy” Lim. “But when I actually thought about it, I knew that wouldn’t really fit. He’s League’s big bad! I needed to make sure I did that justice, so I wanted to create something more unexpected than just another guy in armor.”

This sucks. This is the only mention of mordekaiser. How in the name of god is he league's big bad? They talk about the armor being too similar to morde but all the other similarities are completely fine? With all the ruination and shadow isles stuff it seems as if morde is just being ignored. Although it was confirmed that the death realm and mordes power isnt connected to the ruination, it was confirmed that he can use the harrowing as a gateway to Runeterra.

Morde is currently waiting for an oppurtunity to return to runeterra and begin his reign again, and this seems like to perfect oppurtunity to do so, but it is extremely unlikely to happen. This goes back to a point I made on this sub a bit ago where morde is too powerful that he cannot interact with characters or runeterra without ruining (hehe) runeterra.

Its just frustrating to know that morde could and probably should return to runeterra to continue conquering, especially with the recent release of Rell, but he isnt going to. Viego being a budgeted version of morde to fulfill the fantasy he is supposed to fulfill without ruining the story just rubs salt in the wound. I would love to see him interact with the ruination, and it sucks knowing that Viego it going  be doing everything he would instead.

TLDR; Viego is stealing morde's theme and it feels like riot is going to replace him with Viego.

:(  


Also bad spelling<|endoftext|>I don't think I've ever beaten these two. Darius wins any straight fight, and it's hard to poke him with Q when he can then pull and either kill or almost kill you. Tryndamere seems similar where you lose any direct fight post-6, and going anywhere near the wave makes you instantly die because he can spin on top of you, slow and kill you seemingly no matter what. 

The obvious strategy is to just play safe, but it seems impossible to do that since both of them kill you if you dare go into their pull/spin range, so you can't get a single CS. It feels like they're both just way, waaay stronger than morde and you can't do anything to them at all besides completely abandon the lane or literally sit under tower the entire time. 

At least champs like Renekton, Urgot, Irelia etc are actual fights and they can't just instantly stomp you, and fiora is a hard counter so it makes sense to have to play stupidly safe or pick a different champ.<|endoftext|>hey guys, lately i've been using this build for morde and honestly it feels better than the riftmaker one for me.


Rocketbelt gives ap,hp,mobility,flat pen,procs rylais demonic and morello, and gives 1 stack of conqueror. For me is a win-win. Pen is a very valuable status for champs with low ap ratios like morde.


The full build is rocketbelt rylais (so no one can escape you) demonic (for extra damage and extra resist on teamfights) morello or thornmail for GW (depending on enemy team) and finish with zhonya or visage (depending on enemy team) very rarely you wont need the GW,  but if you really dont need go both zhonya and visage. Defensive boots depending on enemy team (or sorcs if you are really ahead since defensive boots are for virgins).

Runes are the Standard conqueror + ravenous.<|endoftext|>**Hello there !**

You may know me for some random comment in this subreddit and and a rework concept I made a few months ago.

Well today I try again ! For this time, I present you a concept that make Mordekaiser more a teamfighting Battle-Mage who doesn't give a crap about death.

Disclamier : I'm still bad at making numbers and balance, this is more for giving ideas and having the tough of the Morde Mains. I also do that for the fun of it

Anyway, Let's go !

# Mordekaiser : The Iron Revenant

**Passive: Lord of the Death Realm**

* Mordekaiser converts 20%-40% (based on level) of his AD into AP, his basic attack also deals 30%AP damage and can apply passive magic item effects.

>Mordekaiser’s basic attacks also grants a stack of *Obliteration* for 5 seconds, stacking up to 3 times, with the duration refreshing on the subsequent attacks. Each stack grants an additional 10% bonus attack speed. (aka 10%/20%/30% with 1/2/3 stack)

* When Mordekaiser dies, his armor lays on the ground, and his spirit instantly respawns at base but in the Death Realm, and stays for the duration of the respawn timer. At the end of the duration, Mordekaiser comes back to the Living World at full health with his armor where he stands.

>While in the Death Realm, Mordekaiser regains 55%-70% his health (based on level) within half of his respawn time – the fountain regeneration not working on him - can buy items, and can walk around quickly, his position half given by a mist in the Living World. Mordekaiser can also see any units around him, but he can in no way interact with the Living World, apart with his armor, and nothing in the Living World can interact with him or his armor.  
>  
>Mordekaiser can resurrect himself sooner if he goes to his armor, but by doing so he will come back with only the amount of health he has regenerated. Resurrection with this way will produce a shockwave, pushing away all nearby enemy.

* At level 6, allies near Mordekaiser (alive or in the Death Realm) are also send to the Death Realm for 10/12/14 seconds (level 6/11/16), and then fades (respawn timer start when they die in the Living World – if their respawn time is lower, they stay for the duration of their respective respawn timer)
* *For fun? (just is just a random idea that fit thematicly)* \- At level 6, any enemy that is killed by Mordekaiser goes to the death realm for 10 seconds, and then fades (respawn timer start when they die in the Living World – if their respawn time is lower, they stay for the duration of their respective respawn timer)

**Q – Mace of Spade**

CD: 10/8.5/7/5.5/4 sec

* Active (0.5 second cast): Mordekaiser Smashes the ground in a target direction, dealing 65/85/105/125/145 (+60%AP) (+50%AD) magic damage.
* Casting Mace of Spade consume all *“Obliteration”* stacks, boosting its damage by 10%-30%/20%-40%/30%-50% (based on level) (numbers of stacks: 1/2/3)

**W – Harvester of Sorrow**

CD: 16/14/12/10/8 sec

* Passive: Mordekaiser stores 30% of the damage he deals as Potential Shield on his secondary resource bar, up to 30% of his maximum HP + 5% AP. The potential shield decays by 1% of its max HP every second after not dealing or taking damage for 3 seconds, to a minimum of 5% of his max HP.
* Active: Mordekaiser consume the Potential Shield and shield himself for 4 seconds for the same amount.

>For the same duration, he also surrounds himself with a damaging AoE, dealing 30/40/50/60/70 (+20%AP) (+5% target max health) magic damage per seconds to all enemies, and gains 8% bonus movement speed, slowly decreasing to 4% over the duration of the spell.  
>  
>At the end of the spell or if recast within the 4 seconds, Harvester of Sorrow activate it’s second effect. Recasting instantly stop the speed bonus.

* Recast: Mordekaiser constrict the area, dealing 50/80/110/140/170 (+30%AP) magic damage to all enemies near himself, and heals himself for the same amount. Healing is reduced to 25% for minions.

>Mordekaiser also gain a new shield for 2 seconds that equals to 30% of the total damage dealt by the recast.

**E – Atma’s Spears (can be used when moving)**

CD: 16/14.5/13/11.5/10 sec

* Active (0.3 sec cast): Mordekaiser summon ghostly spears in a squared area, granting sight and dealing 40/65/90/115/140 (+60% AP) (+50% AD) magic damage to all enemies hit, and 55% of Atma’s Spears CD is refunded.
* If Atma’s Spears his held down for more than 0.35 sec, Mordekaiser start charging the spell up to 3 seconds to increase Atma’s Spears range after a 0.5 second of channelling. The spell can be released any time within its duration.

>When released or at the end of the charge, Mordekaiser unleash a line of ghostly spears (not projectile) from him to a target location, dealing only 65% of Atma’s Spears magic damage.  
>  
>Upon reaching the targeted area or hitting an enemy champion or monster, spears erupt around the spot in a square area, neutralizing any enemy hit for 1 second and dealing 130% of Atma’s Spears magic damage.

1. If Mordekaiser is interrupted during the charge, Atma’s Spear is cancelled and 55 % of its CD is refunded.
2. For each enemy champion hit with Atma’s Spear (charge or not), Mordekaiser generate 15%/17.5%/20%/22.5%/25% bonus Potential Shield for Harvester of Sorrow.

**R – Children of the Grave**

CD: 160/130/100

* Passive – Dragon Force: Mordekaiser’s basic attacks and abilities Curse the Dragon for 10 seconds. If the Dragon is killed by Mordekaiser’s team when Cursed, Mordekaiser store its Ghost for 120 seconds for later use.

>Mordekaiser lose the stored Ghost Dragon if he is killed

* Active: Mordekaiser unleash his powers and summon around him his Ghost Warriors from Mitna Rachnun for 20/40/60 seconds.

>Level 6: 2 Soldiers  
>  
>Level 11: 3 Soldiers and 1 Archer  
>  
>Level 16: 4 soldiers and 2 Archers

* The soldiers will attack the nearest enemy to Mordekaiser when he is in combat, prioritizing champions.

>Mordekaiser can recast Children of the Grave to put a mark on any enemy champion or structure in range, making the Ghost Warriors attack this specific target when Mordekaiser is in combat. The mark can be changed as much as Mordekaiser wants during the spell duration (2 sec CD between each change). Casting the mark on a marked target removes it.



* If any dead ally is still in the Death Realm when Children of the Grave is launched, they are resurrected with full HP and mana/energy but with 60%/65/70% of their stats (AD/AP/AS/maxHp/maxMana-Energy/Armor/MR) and for 15/25/35 seconds, after which they fade.

1. Any “living” ally that dies during Children of the Graves is resurrected, but with only 50%/55%/60% of their stats and for half the time, then fade.
2. Children of the Grave can be cast when in the Death Realm, fully resurrecting Mordekaiser with 70%/80%/90% of his maxHP.

Casted this way, only the ally’s part of the spell is activated (No Ghost Warrior is summoned)

* Active – Dragon Force: If a Ghost Dragon is stored, Mordekaiser summons it instead of his Ghost Warriors when casting Children of the Grave.

>The Ghost Dragon stays for 20/30/40 seconds, it acts and can be controlled the same way as the Ghost Warrior.  
>  
>This Active doesn’t initiate the ally’s resurrection part of the spell, but refund 50% of it’s CD when the Ghost Dragon dies or expires.

* Killing Mordekaiser when Children of the Grave or Dragon Force is active instantly ends all of its effects and put it on CD.

* Possess 60% of Mordekaiser stats, but 100% of his MS, AS, range, attacks do magic damage and deal 50-150 (level) bonus magic damage. Double their MS until their reach their target at the start of a fight. Can do that again after 3 second out of combat. Attcks don’t applies magic items effects.

***Ghost Archer:***

* Possess 40% of Mordekaiser stats, but 120% of his MS, AS, AD, 500 of range, attacks do magic damage and deal 50-150 (level) bonus magic damage. Attcks applies magic items effects.

***Ghost Dragon:***

* Sadly this one I don't know how to balance



Well then, let's put my tough process :

Riot, when talking about Mordekaiser rework, spoked about giving him a passive that let him go to the Death Realm (DR) but didn't find a way to make it good.

So I decided to start with that becasue i found the idea interersting.

Mordekaiser -being the Lord of the Dead- doesn't give a damn about being dead, so I gave options for this "walking around while dead" and coupled it with his new ult (who is just his Old ult revisited with Old Yorick ult):

1. Scouting : Mordekaiser can get a grasp of what is happening in the Living World (LW), getting precious data for his teamates, and can walk around quite fast in DR
2. Suprise attacks : while Mordekaiser isn't completly invisible in the LW, his position isn't totaly given -) the mist ins't clean like Senna E, I imagine something like Akali Shroud with a unconsitent mist
3. Sharing is dominating : to make things more spicy, I decided to share the DR with allies. But because they don't have enough will and power, they only stay for a moment and only come back temporarly because Morde wants it. This gives option for some revenge and fights comeback that Old Morde could make.
4. I also didn't want to put the DR to waste.
5. I also added the Ghost Warrior for more teamfight shenanigans. trading the "enslaving the enemy soul" for "having you personal ghost army"

Q : the same as the current, just some tweak with the passive to make it fell more Old Morde.

W : inspired with someo others rework idea (i forgot your names, but godspeed to you), making an hybrid between current W and Old W for better fight durability and sustain.

E : I completly revisited this one because the hand is completly whack.

1. I took back Old Morde E, but gave it some spices and tweak to make it a poke/preparation ability that work with the W I "made", while also tweaking it with a charge to give Morde more expression



I hope you enjoyed this read, some feedback are really aprreciated (you can be harsh, the more data I have the better i get)<|endoftext|>Ha has less armor than old Morde lategame and old Morde had 25 base armor for anyone asking current is 88 old was 92.5

...<|endoftext|>So I want to know against which champions I should avoid picking morde in top lane, and which ones morde is strong against. Plain and simple, thank you.<|endoftext|>

I don't want to start any dispute or whatever and i'm not targeting anyone specifically, but I feel like Morde mains have been very negative about s11 Mordekaiser for no real reason. Like, I understand his winrate isn't THAT great, that QSS or any cleansing spell/item can be a problem, but otherwise I dont understand why people are complaining so much about him.

Like, let's be honest, Rift Maker is still a huge buff for him. The old Liandry one item power spike is still here, the item just doesnt do the exact same thing. I've been commenting already on posts that were complaining about Morde and it was mostly people saying "come on be realistic, the champion aint good blah blah", like, no dude, the champion IS good lets be real. I mean when you're done with laning and pop up in a fight with Rift Maker, Zhonya's and Rylai you're a fucking nightmare to deal with. Plus Mordekaiser (don't bring that QSS bullshit please, i've heard it enough, and it's not like the 5 opponents will build one anyways) with his ult is still the best 1on1 champ in the game.

I just make this post because i'd like to see if there are people actually thinking like me in this sub, or if I'm really the only Morde player that is happy with how the champ does right now. I understand that you might not be completely fan of s11 Morde, but come on guys he can't be THAT bad, can he ?<|endoftext|>So, looking at Morde’s ult you can see that leveling it up doesn’t do anything apart from reducing its cool down. The same static 10% drain of all stats remains the same as always, and it’s honestly the most boring part of the ult. Once everyone and their mother have purchased QSS, or just have one of the many abilities to get them out scot-free, it’s a rather lackluster and useless ult come late game.

This requires morde to have AD scaling as well, but what I was thinking is that the stat drain scales with the amount of the stats Mord possesses. To put this in perspective, if Morde has something like 200 armor and he ults a malphite, he’ll steal perhaps... 25% of his armor along with all the other stats.

Essentially, the more attack speed you build, the more you steal, the more AP you build, the more you steal, the more armor and magic resist you build, etc.

This, along with AD scalings could make Morde incredibly versatile with his build path instead of the linear path he follows now.

The base amount that will be stolen will need to be reduced for the sake of balance though, and this base amount will increase when you level the ult, so something like 4%/8/12% or 3%/6%/9%. Either way, I believe this change could open up so many different possibilities for Morde, and really flesh out his ult as a unique ability.<|endoftext|>Now many would say, then why is Malz ult cleansable using QSS  


With mord ult, you can 

\- Use zhonyas to literally skip half the duration of the ult

\- Kite the living fck out of him (he has 330 movement speed iirc)

\- If he misses Q/E in ult then he has no kill pressure on you



Idk why they need to nerf more of his ult, he has negative wr in almost every tier except gold<|endoftext|>You can actualy kill the "test dummys" with mordekaiser. How?

And if Morde dies after taking someone's stats and Viego becomes Morde does he get the bonus stats too or just Morde's regular stats?

If so please let me know, I'm trying to learn more about the game and how this champion works<|endoftext|>Aside from what I think about his rework in totality, I wish Riot would just revert him to at least being a battle mage. It's obvious AP Juggernaut is just not really a thing. Give him AP ratios on his W, take the magic pen off his E and increase base damage or ratio. Or just give him a different E. This would keep current kit mostly intact, but also make at least some older Morde players happier. I feel like there is a lot they could do to bridge the two sides of the community while going away from the sinking ship that is the class of "AP Juggernaut" which functionally doesn't even exist.<|endoftext|>Lets be honest the current state of Mordekaiser is not the most fun you have had...  
Im mostly doing this post to see if people would want Mordekaiser to switch to being able to use AD items such as steraks , stridebreaker and deaths dance which will help him ALOT..  
I do realise that.. its not happening and it wont happen bcs lets be honest Riot doesnt like admitting they failed.  
Anyways here is a pole

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kzr5zb)<|endoftext|>At beggining I wasn't mad iron man passive was gone, but looking now, morde doesn't have anything unique that resembles old morde, no ghost no shielding no big bonks no healing, his passive is the thing  I miss the most, drain tanks like aatrox exist that keeps healing based on damage, why couldn't morde keep his shielding based on damage like seriously, the ghost is understandable, but why not the passive he is a goddam juggernaut give him proper combat sustain<|endoftext|>I think if Mordekaiser had like a stack mechanic on q this would allow more build diversity since you would always be stacking damage on q.

Maybe something like if you hit a single champion you get a stack 0.075% ap and when hiting a isolated target he gets a stack 0.5%ap.



Mordekaiser e should apply a slow to enemy champion so he can acually get to them before they can run away.

dunno just some ideas.<|endoftext|>I had an enemy morde yesterday and I took QSS and he wasted his ult on me like 5 times. This was like a bronze match so the dude was so confused in all chat. I love QSS<|endoftext|>Since Liandry's has been reworked into Mana mage item, we're forced to build demonic embrace every game to do any damage, Riftmaker sucks and got nerfed, doesn't give enough damage. Morde would love to build new Liandry's but it's unviable to build due to the massive waste of stats on mana, and it gives no hp which Morde requires to remain somewhat tanky, as his shield doesn't scale with ap but with hp for some weird reason. Forced to build Zhonya every game so you don't get blown up the second you come out of R. Morde would really like to build ability haste but there are only two options for ability haste that aren't Mana lost chapter mythics, Zhonyas which only gives 10 ability haste and is generally always viable on Morde or Banshee's veil which Morde generally never builds. There are barely any ap ability haste options, you'd think they'd create some viable ap bruisers items which provide some form of ability haste to get access to lower cooldowns, but Morde seriously lacks any options for ability haste besides tank items, like Spirit Visage gives what 10 ability haste I guess, Morde would love to build Cosmic Drive for that sweet 30 ability haste and move speed, but since it only gives a measly 200 hp, and Morde is gated by having to build Riftmaker and Demonic embrace to be able to draintank, Morde is better off building tank items or Rylais for sticking power. Morde is seriously limited by the lack of ap bruiser mythics he can build, and I wish Riot implemented more items that Morde could opt into, rather than the same linear build path almost every single game.<|endoftext|>How good would frostfire gauntlet be on mordekaiser? How good is the slow?<|endoftext|>**Morde E:**

Like E has a 24 / 21 / 18 / 15 / 12 second cooldown. What utter silliness is that? Mordekaiser has no gap closers and has terrible movement speed. 24 seconds where you have zero threat potential is a dead sentence in solo lanes. Especially since leveling it first isn't viable in lane means it's not until level 13 that you get a decent cooldown on it. It should be at least 20/18/16/14/12 or even 18/16/14/12/10 cooldown scaling.

**Morde W:**

W is not a real ability. On paper it has a reasonable 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 cooldown time.  But in reality, its cooldown is gated twice by Mordekaiser's mechanics. Using it without at least half of his passive built is a complete joke of a defensive ability so you have to wait for the passive to build. Secondly, the cooldown doesn't start when you use it, it starts when you consume your shield (which generally you want to hold for most of the 4 second duration. And lastly, and most infuriating, is that MORDEKAISER DOESN'T GET TO BUILD HIS PASSIVE BAR WHILE USING HIS SHIELD. How does that make any sense!?

I can count the number of times I've gotten two max shield Ws in a teamfight on a single hand because of how stupidly his W mechanics are implemented. Either give his W a Sett sized shield to reward Morde players for its restrictions or make it a lower cooldown. Or entirely rework it because it's not even fun to use.

**Morde R:**

His ultimate cooldown would be fine if his basic abilities were actually properly tuned but as is, Mordekaiser is not a champion without his ultimate up.

**Morde Q:**

The cooldown is fine although I find that because Q's base damage scales on Mordekaiser's level means that you get easily snowballed on if behind because Morde's main damage ability is level gated. Bad design choice.<|endoftext|>and Morde is now one of the lowest ranking champs for Top<|endoftext|>In teamfights he feels rather squishy like ap assassin but with no mobility and lower damage. Especially if there no tanks in team (frontline) i tend to get kited and lose hp for nothing in exchange.<|endoftext|>I'm wanting to try him out in the jungle more.<|endoftext|>Title. IIRC the reasoning behind removing his AD ratios was that it made his itemization always gunblade. Now that gunblade is gone there's no excuse to not give us AD ratios. I'd really like to build stuff like steraks and titanic without being 100% trolling<|endoftext|>Anybody else have their heart broken watching kingen get stomped as Morde? Do you think it was his mistakes or the champion just being in a bad spot?

Personally I think Morde can still be a useful pick in pro play as we’ve seen in the LPL however that was season 10 so that might misrepresent how effective Morde can be in this new season of dashes, burst, and cheap grievous.<|endoftext|>I joined in season 10 so u know why a person would write that title,but really tho.
I saw a montage of old morde R and it was like teemo shrooms but like, it killed with full hp and he just sat there looking at them while they die. It looked really broken,but there has to be something that im missing?

How did his ult work?how was it not annoying to die full hp with zonnias when he R'ed u?

I didnt make this post to be disrespectful to this community.i just wanna understand more.<|endoftext|>This item has been abused by a lot of assassins which caused Riot to nerf it, causing it's actual intended users like Singed and Morde to suffer (people hate playing vs Morde and call him OP, but let's be real - he has a 47-48% winrate). My idea to make it more consistent damage oriented is to change it's passive to:

Damaging a champion with attacks or abilities grants you a stack (max 1 stack per 0.75 seconds, but each stack falls off every 1.5 seconds - this would prevent a champion like Akali from being able to fully stack it. At the same time damage from items like Demonic Embrace wouldn't be able to refresh or add stacks). Each stack causes you to deal 2% bonus damage as true damage(1% for ranged users since they would have a much easier time stacking it). Stacks up to 5 times. 
This way the Item would both grant you counterplay against it since kiting and stunning opponents would keep resetting their stacks. At the same time it would grant the users a bit of true damage from the start so they wouldnt feel weak at all.<|endoftext|>Hello! I'm pretty new here.

Altough i have had like 9cs per min and i was 3-0 i still couldnt even 1v2. Meanwhile i am pretty sure i am going into 1v3 fights with Darius at this point. I thought recent Q buff would help him but it still feels really weak. Do you still play morde at this point ? Or do you just wait for some rework or something ?<|endoftext|>

what do you guys think about protobelt or turbo chemtank as 1st item (for the mobility and stickiness)  with ghost and  flash in lane 

i feel like once lvl 6 they can't kite him and he wins the lane from that point forward 

do you guys think that morde would be a nice counter pick to the ranged top laners with this setup ? 

tell me your thoughts<|endoftext|>I would like to see better base stat scalings raise his armor from 37 + 3 per level to 39 + 4 and health from 90 to 100 Morde being the slowest Juggernaut is ok on my opinion Just as long as he is properly compensate for it 

One other thing that could be done Is give him a Aftershock type effects on his W where you gain 10/20/30/40/50 armor and mr while the shield persist helping him scale into the lategame and encouraging more diversity Is his secondary runes dropping the ToB Rav for maybe a revitalize making the shield stronger thus prolonging the "aftershock" state and making him a better frontline with maybe a conditioning or shield bash this would also make leveling his W actually impactful and satisfying wich would be a really nice thing to have 

Another thing they could do Is give him more Attack Speed per level right now is 0.625 + 1% they could make that 0.625 + 3% so that no going Nashor's doesnt cripple him quite as much

I feel like there are a lot of things that can be done to make him feel a lot more satisfying 

Of course in not suggesting they should do all of these but i feel like these are some of the better ways of buffing him without buffing his movement speed or passive duration 

Opinions ?<|endoftext|>Riot seems to like giving champions on hit effects on abilities to compensate for preseason.

I say Morde should get a buff that makes his passive proc on hit effects every second, this way we could viably build Nashors tooth and Lichbane.

I don’t see any future complications with BotRK or Kraken Slayer.<|endoftext|>Hey guys! I was reading a few other posts and was thinking about mordekaiser’s current strength in the meta, and he just doesn’t feel as strong even when ahead. 

I wonder if it’s maybe due to our build path. I like riftmaker for the sustain and damage, but it seems like riftmaker is more of a scaling item. 

Maybe if we build items like demonic embrace into riftmaker or buy seekers/leer into embrace then finish up with riftmaker it might be a bit better?

I am relatively new to the game, so I’m looking forward to hearing your guys’ thoughts!!

TL;DR: Build another item like demonic embrace before finishing mythic.<|endoftext|>smurf and main acc

Look i heard it enough times, ok?


Anyone else?<|endoftext|>I don't mean LITERALLY give him Nasus ult. If you don't know what Nasus ult does it's very simple, Nasus gains bonus health, armor, magic resist, 50 bonus attack range, 50% CDR on his Q, and AOE damage around him. The danger with Nasus isn't his tankiness, it is his Q every ONE second while in ult form. That is like an auto attack. 

Of all the buffs within Nasus Ult, I only want one of them for Morde. 50% CDR on all of his skills until death realm is over, which is only 8 seconds, compared to Nasus 15 second. It is kind of dumb how Morde's E has a 30 second cool down at level 1. And this skill isn't even all that amazing, its a pull that has a charge up time, and does not stun or immobilize when pulled. While Sett's pull IMMOBILIZES and Pulls, AND stuns. If you miss, good luck you will NEVER catch your prey. And even if you hit them, you better wish they don't have a skill that dashes or simply out speeds your 335 base movement speed.

It is really not fair to land your pull, and your Q on Nunu, for him to simply roll a snow ball and out speed Morde. 

Giving Morde 50% CDR on all of his skills for only 8 seconds would really bring him back. I don't even want 50%, I would settle for 25% CDR on all skills for 8 seconds.<|endoftext|>Idk why people don’t build rylais.

And as I learn to use different items and adapt I also find I despise some of my Lane Matchups and thoroughly enjoy others.

When it comes to top lane I do enjoy going against Vayne, Teemo and Nasus as my kind of top three. Especially in their early game for Vayne and Teemo. I find that because they tend to believe they can duel Melee Champs on top Matchups they play far to aggressive and kind of burn Champion abilities and push too early.         Though in the opposite side I dislike going against Illaoi, Gnar and Garen. I like to play aggressive but the sort of kits they have kind of feel like they outdo the prolonged fights early game. Most late game depends on how you build I think but this is just my learning experience thus far. 

In the Jungle it can be a hit or miss sort of thing. Kayn, Shyvana and Lee sin I tend to usually Enjoy having as the eneny Jungle but I Find myself struggling a bit against Olaf, Ekko and Sett. Though some of these can be sorted with my Ult I dislike going against Olaf for his easy way of escaping the Ult. Ekko is just. A bugger to move towards and around. Setts early is pretty Killer.

This is my first real post about the frustration and robbery of my beloved character Mordekaiser. I loved him but he is not what he usdd to be then riot comes along and takes even more from him. So here is my rantg about viego and why I think Mordekaiser deserves to be fixed.


REALLY? THEY TAKE AWAY MORDE ULT BECAUSE IT'S "TOO BUGGY" Proceeds to give Viego BOTH of Mordekaiser ult BUT IN A PASSIVE AND HE HAS ACCESS TO THEIR ABILITIES AS WELL AS ITEMS? I swear this is some straight up bullshit!!! Like they take away everything that made Mordekaiser, Mordekaiser then proceed to give some e-boy looking champ BOTH ults? I just can't put my frustration into words. Granted he doesn't get a ghost ai but he still possess them (similar to old morde) then he has access TO THEIR STATS AND ITEMS. Like why? You strip away our character made him a dumbed down version, then remove his good items and make up for it by buffing his q by 10? THEN YOU HAVE THE NERVE TO GIVE THIS BITCH OF A CHARACTER BOTH OF HIS ULTS AS A PASSIVE??? HONESTLY FUCK YOU RIOT GAMES. I can't stand this. If this goes through then BRING GHOST ULT BACK. I will give anything to have ghost ult if this simp Viego gets this CRACKED AF PASSIVE. Like you can't just take an old champ ult turn  it into a passive and say the ult is too buggy. JUST ADMIT YOU DIDN'T LIKE MORDEKAISER YOU FRAUDS. THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

[https://open.spotify.com/playlist/24kNKeua1GxLSAn2aq3T2q](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/24kNKeua1GxLSAn2aq3T2q)<|endoftext|>Hello, guys!
I need some tips for this match up. Last Game, I played Mordekaiser vs Rengar and he just stomped me. He had a lot of damage, go out of your r and your e, go to melee so easily. I feelt i cant do nothing. I am so grateful if you guys give some tips to fight him since lvl 1 at the end of the game. 
Thanks!<|endoftext|>I hear everywhere people saying demonic embrace is bad but fail to see why. Gives hp and extra armour in extended trades which is what morde is made for. Also really good to destroy tanks with %hp damage...<|endoftext|>So me and my buddy were joshing around with Mordekaiser ideas when we thought of something great for Mordekaiser’s ult.

As we all know by now, Morde’s ult is incredibly lacklustre for what it is. Being able to 1v1 someone and stealing their stats is pretty good, but if you fail to kill them or they kite you till your ult goes off isn’t so good. He doesn’t feel like a juggernaut anymore, coming off as a nuisance to enemy bruisers and tanks who can survive the 1v1 confrontation. Not to mention how we’re incentivized to target the weak and squishy champions with our ult is a bit of a character-lore letdown, since Morde wants the strong and hardened.

So here’s what we came up with —
1. Ult scales into late game, not through stats. Instead, Mordekaiser summons ghastly warriors into the death realm the longer he and his opponent are engaged in there. 
At ult level 1, the max warriors Mordekaiser could summon is three, dealing 30 + 1% of the enemy’s current health as magic damage. They’ll also slow the enemy by 10%, decaying rather quickly. 
At level 3 ult, the max becomes 7 with 80 + 1% current health magic damage per hit. They’re summoned every 2-1.5-1 second spent within the death realm. If Mordekaiser kills their opponent within the death realm, they become part of the ghastly crew and are summoned back into the material realm together with how many warriors Mordekaiser summoned. Stats cut by 70/60/50% based on ult level.

2. Time within the death realm is 7-8-10 seconds, upping every ult level.

3. Warriors summoned cannot be targeted or killed within the death realm, since they’re already dead. But if Mordekaiser is successful in killing the champion he ulted and they are brought into the living realm, they can be killed/banished back to where they came from. Health equal to 30% of the defeated champion max HP, though they only have 20/30/40 armor and MR. Movement speed is still being debated, though consensus is at a base 365.

4. If Morde fails to kill their target, Mordekaiser will instead strip them of 10/15/20% of their core stats for 5 seconds as their soul slowly stabilizes from the violation. Though he does not gain their stats.

5. If they QSS, GP eats an orange or is otherwise countered during the death realm phase. Mordekaiser becomes enraged and immediately summons the ghastly warriors into the world. These warriors gain health equal to 20% of Mordekaiser’s health, since he can’t use the enemy champion’s soul as minion kibble fodder.

6. Lastly, the ghosts would target the closest champion available. Changing target if there’s an enemy champion with lower health than their current target.

-

Let us know what you think, honestly this sounds a little too much like a beefy Malzahar with how the minion thing operates. But we feel like it’s much more in line with his lore, and what Mordekaiser was like back in his pre-rework state.<|endoftext|>Damn you all are a little deprived for me to write a crappy aatrox and morde Kaiser fanfic though there’s like 3 days left till the polls are gone<|endoftext|>So viego has a circlet for his crown right? And morde has an actual crown floating above his head. So to the mist is morde stronger than viego? Or is viego more useful? Do they both count as rulers to the mist? Well i don't know that's why im asking so feel free to discuss the answers in the comments.
Edit: did not know morde was no longer part of the isles.<|endoftext|>Should I make a aatrox x morde fanfic

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ku5mpo)<|endoftext|>I see a lot people picking demonic embrace but isnt rylais better on morde because of the slow? When do you pick which item?<|endoftext|>
Hey y’all im a mordekaiser main, i just started playing lol about 2 weeks ago and I’ve been experimenting with some builds but they just dont feel right

Any tips on a “delete” level amount of damage build for mordekaiser ?

Thanks in advance :)<|endoftext|>For clarification, I was facing an Illaoi and I had a Lvl advantage over her. I was 6 and she was 5. I decided to push on her with my ult. While I was beating her, she suddenly became lvl.6 and killed me.  The experience likely answer my own question, but I wanna make sure through others.<|endoftext|>So basically you go conqueror, triumph, tenacity, last stand, taste of blood and ravenous hunter.

For items: Riftmaker > Ravenous Hydra > Spirit Visage. 

Then either go full tank so you can legit never die or just go demonic embrace/ Nashors/ morellos.

I´d personally always get stopwatch/ zhonias since i like to 1v5, get my passive, be about 35% health and then stopwatch just to see how juicy that selfheal is.

very fun build and you will never ever be under 50% health out of combat.<|endoftext|>Soo I don't want to flame or look for flame and please keep the comments as salt free as possible. Does anyone else feel like Viego is the better mordekaiser rework? sure kitwise he doesn't have shield mechanics like old morde used to, but arguably new morde's shield is just as meh. he got the gap closing/cc which was lacking in old morde with the w, the q is obviously not a bonk but it works as a stab which looks similarly to the old old morde q. and well e is sth completely different from morde design but themewise fits him better (I might be wrong but wasn't old morde sorta able to control the black mist?) lastly welp ultimate is an execute sort of ability, which is for sure more fitting for a rework than new Morde's r. idk If they also added hybrid scaling (which I doubt, cause champ seems more of a bruiser ish).

TLDR: welp riot being riot. What do you think? will you play it or does it just piss you off? Personally I'll try it and hope its somewhat fun cause I miss playing morde<|endoftext|>I'm not a Mordekaiser main (in fact I've never played the new Morde), I just came here to rant. One of you - heartless humans - ulted a pick 10 seconds before our drake soul @ minute 22 spawned. All other 4 of us could do nothing but wait while the entire enemy team had enough time to arrive, save his teammate and kill us all - with big shutdowns.

\>:(<|endoftext|>What if at the end of the season, after the whole ruined king story is finished (which will probobly be shown in a cinematic) after the credits we get a Avengers-like scene where Mordekauser, Tanos style says *Fine, I'll do it myself? Just a random thought i had while watching his voice lines video.<|endoftext|>I really like the look of Morde's hood he gets after killing someone in the death realm. I think it would be nice if we could get a ctrl + 5 like kaisa to have the hood on.

I know it isn’t much but it effectively becomes an 6-10% MS increase.

And/or

If that wasn’t much, maybe give his 2nd cast w a small ranged pull in?

And/or

When morde passive is activated, his basic abilities grant additional perks. Landing Q on an enemy gives a flat 5MS per enemy champ or slows.

W 2nd cast does burst damage equivalent to % of shield.

E has a faster cast animation.


One of these buffs or a combination of them would fit thematically with his kit of being a juggernaut. He will still have trouble initially getting on to someone BUT, he will have an easier time staying on them if they get close enough.<|endoftext|>For some reason Viego and Morde look like they have something in common I know that most of you will say it's the crown and yes that is giving off some vibes, but it's really suspicious since there hasn't been any new lore to Morde and I fell like it's time for that to change. Anyone else agree?<|endoftext|>I think it is time us morde mains have to agree on the point that morde sucks ass.

He sits at 48 percent winrate even with his recent q buff.

He has a terrible early game even with dorans shield you lose nearly every matchup until level 6 and when you finally reach level 6 if you cannot kill your opponent you have to wait 140 seconds before you can touch them again.

You would think that a champion that has this weak of an early game would scale so much but he unfortunately doesnt even if you get 10 kills when the game gets long enough every champ gets to a point where they can survive in your ult.

His e gets countered really easy by champions that have high movement speed or just dash abilites sometimes i wonder if it is a cool arm picture on the floor i get to use every 24 seconds.

I love playing morde but im tired. I would like to hear your thoughts.<|endoftext|>At this point I would sacrifice my family for old morde... I joined league just about the time aatrox got reworked and I never played the old aatrox. I enjoyed the new one and made fun to my friend who was constantly complaining about the rework that they did him a favour. NO THEY BUTCHERED MY BOY - he said. After a while he quit the game and his last words were " all of you morde mains will be struck by a tragedy". Fuck you - i replied and never heard of him again. Years pass by nad morde rework is announced. I was hyped like everybody else thinking that mordekaiser will finally become a badass and I was dying for him to be released. Until he actually released... it was horrible, this champion feels like a retarded darius mixed with a retarded swain. His ult reminds me of legion cimmander of Dota 2. I couldn't bear playing him. I tried full tank, I tried full ap, i even tried crit. Sure it felt fun becoming immortal and just tanking 5 people at once, or hitting a penta kill with 2 clicks, or getting reported. But it wasn't as satisying as playing old morde. I remember when I picked morde back then my teammates were like " ah shit here goes my elo" and then the enemy is like "THAT CHAMP IS FUCK8NG BUSTED RITO FIX WTF ,, IM GAY" and me just laughing as I flashed in the middle of their team get to almost 100 hp and w to full health with my dragon blasting them all to hell. If only they just reworked the GUI and not the kit. Anyways enough lamenting about something that will never change. 

Lord Mordekaiser, wherever you are just know that we all miss you, seems like league was  not fit to handle such a badass.

I love you.<|endoftext|>Okay so some members of Morde Mains and myself just collectively came up with a crazy lore theory involving Viego. In a nutshell, the theory is that Viego is a puppet being manipulated by Mordekaiser

(Credit for assisting with this theory goes to Discord users: an absolute loser#1278 & RaidBossMorde#7686)

Canonically, the Ruination is after Mordekaiser's second reign. Therefore after the Ruination, Mordekaiser either notices the spectral energy coming from the area or one of his cultists informs him. Either way he takes note of The Shadow Isles and Viego. Since Viego is practically insane on account of searching for his wife for centuries, he would be extremely easy to manipulated if Mordekaiser just masqueraded as Isolde. Alternatively, Viego could've made a pact with Mordekaiser in a desperate attempt to find Isolde. Now, Mordekaiser's grand plan is to have Viego and the forces of the Shadow Isles weaken the living world before unleashing his own army from Mitna Rochnun to begin his Final Reign.

There is also plenty of evidence to support this theory. For one, both Mordekaiser's and Viego's crowns are identical. On top of that, Viego has no interactions with Mordekaiser whatsoever which is odd. Mordekaiser can also only take souls from the area around Noxus. The Shadow Isles is similar, only souls that die around there or where the Black Mist goes can be trapped. Mordekaiser could potentially be using Viego as an outlet to collect more souls.  We know from the Season 11 cinematic the mist spreads further and further out each time, and it just reached Noxus, Ionia, and Demacia. And where did the mist first erupt in Noxus? The Immortal Bastion, the former headquarters for Mordekaiser when he occupied the living world. Finally, Swain has a voiceline where he states: "A king remains in the mist, and another marches". Possibly hinting at this being a twist that will be revealed later on this year. 

So what do you guys think?<|endoftext|>"Mordekaiser strides out of the great hall, toward the heart of his fortress, the centerpiece of his power and his machinations. Toward the relic that ties Mitna Rachnun to the mortal realm. Toward the place that gives the secret heart of the Immortal Bastion its true purpose."
-The Final Reign

The Immortal Bastion is literally the center of Mordekaiser's kingdom and it is literally his gateway to runeterra, itll be fucking stupid if some genshin impact looking motherfucker just comes along and uses his portal without him noticing.<|endoftext|>viego(the ruined king) doesnt have any interactions with morde :(

Remember how they said "we can't keep the ghost because he creates a lot of problems"? Well, new champion Viego literally allows you to play as someone else. They couldn't keep tibbers with champion passives but they can make you play other champions? Isn't Viego's situation just more complicated? If you can make us play as another champion (literally using your enemies' passive-Q-W-E) you should be able to let us control a pet that is actually tibbers but with passives. They literally just disassembled morde and now they are reusing it. His old passive? Well, it's his new (and shitty) W! His old Q? Well, they couldn't get anything for it but I bet they will. His old W? Attaching to someone and having an AoE effect around you? Just look at Rell's E! His old E? Hitting people in a cone and gaining shield for the amount of people you hit? It's Yone's W! His old ult? Putting a DoT on people and controlling them (just walking around and autoing)? The DoT is gone but Viego's passive is completely the same as mordekaiser puppets, only difference being that Viego's is harder to implement. If they were going to keep his abilities, why even rip them from morde? Why even rework the champion if you are going to bring everything he had, but seperately? Couldn't you just re-code the whole champion? He was buggy as hell, true, but If you could fix those bugs why didn't you? If you couldn't fix them, why are you implementing them?<|endoftext|>Maybe you all didn't see the recent videos of Riot about what they will do in season 11 (go watch it), but what is the most important here is the next champion : Viego, The Ruined King.

To get why I put this title, I strongly recommend you watch this video I will put : it's Viego's abilities, and I think you will find the passive VERY familliar...  
 [Viego, The Ruined King Ability Reveal | New Champion - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx9CUujjMcU) 

And I honeslty want the Morde mains opinions on it...



In short : Viego's passive is litteraly our dear Old Morde ult with some seasonings.

Riot said they couldn't make Old Morde ult work for New Morde, so they removed it and replace it with a boring one, and now they put it **AS A PASSIVE for a new champion ??? Excuse me what ???**

Am I sorry for this rage post ? Yes, but this is still outerageous and I needed venting.

Will I try Viego ? Probably, but not as a jungler (just to RUIN the thing, and also because I suck at jungle)<|endoftext|>How do you think these two will interact when they meet during Viego's conquest? Honestly hoping that Mordekaiser puts him in the dirt for "trying to claim what's his"<|endoftext|>What If we took Mordekaiser's ult, said it didn't fit in the new playstyle and then put it on our newest edgelord eboy who is somehow a king as a passive?


'John, you're a fucking genius, you're getting a promotion.'<|endoftext|>I’m pretty sure akali smoke shouldn’t be following her into the death realm, if that’s the case everyone should be walking around the rift with smoke pellets in their pockets when facing morde.<|endoftext|>I can’t seem to find any otp’s for morde and don’t know where to look for more info on learning him for s11. I’m very interested in specific match ups, build paths, and viability in higher elos. The highest ranking mordes all look like they pocket pick him and just play a variety of top laners.<|endoftext|>With every ADC going Galeforce some of them have up to 3 or 4 freebies not to mention the ones the literally murder you regardless such as Vayne everyone gets mobility from the new items and some people dashes too its so fucking bad and unfair yes i said It its fucking unfair everyone gets 15 dashes AND QSS<|endoftext|>First of all.. you should be able to cast your W while in Q yes technically speaking its gonna be cheating the cast time.. its still a pain tho

Second bring back stat stealing for specific amount of time like pre rework where it was 45/60/75 depending on the rank of the ability since currently its just kinda dissapointing early game and you only max it for CD..

Third - Pentakill skin should go on sale.

Forth -  Buff the movement speed on the passive when chasing down enemy champions.. the closer you are the smaller the speed will do but when you are chasing say an ADC you should get some kind of realistic movement speed boost that is not just the mere 3%

Fifth - Make him do double damage vs teemo if you disagree you are a filthy teemo main shame on you.

Sixth - Give his E a scalling slow.. As far as i know alot of people already think Mordekaiser E slows so instead of telling them it doesnt just make it slow.  


Seventh - Home dad Mordekaiser skin with a fly swatter instead of a mace i will leave the rest to your imagination.<|endoftext|>Sorry for the awfully generic and repetitive question. Morde isn't really a champ which I've ever picked up but I wanna play him cause his kit looks fun. I keep seeing people saying he's not as good as he used to be or there are better champs to main, though. I'm originally a Renekton, Wukong main, I love playing bruisers with strong splitpushing power top lane. It gives me more control over the game and makes me feel less like I'm being held hostage by teammates, since I can take turrets pr secure objectives on my own. Would Mordekaiser be a good pickup for solo queue or would I just end up frustrated trying to main a champ that's barely any better than my mains?<|endoftext|>Is it any good against ranged or mobile champions with the new buff?<|endoftext|>You guys suck<|endoftext|>[https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/destiny-domination-omnivamp-season-11-589434?revision](https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/build/destiny-domination-omnivamp-season-11-589434?revision)<|endoftext|>Not sure if this does more dps than the full tank sunfire morde maybe someone can crunch the numbers

First back seekers>riftmaker>gargoyle stoneplate>demonic embrace (more tank) or nashors (more damage if starting to carry) 

I love the stacking MR and Armor gargoyle and demonic has and I think morde is one of the only champs that can fully utilize it, I’m just curious if I guess whether sunfire or riftmaker would be better here.<|endoftext|>No, seriously, the amount of kills i have gotten handed to me on a silver platter. Like, can they not kite? Can't they just, fight back? 

In case you're wondering what led to this question, I was a 4/7 Morde Mid at 20 mins in a fucking DIAMOND GAME. We went to dragon cuz we didn't want to surrender third drake. So i go up to blast cone, i ward over the pit with a pink ward. I see my team comin in from the bot side. I jump in, i ult the yi. Sure he was half health, but this was a 20 min yi that had been just farming. He fuckin, ran to the edge, sat for like 3 seconds which i had sent him to quarter of his health by the time he decided to turn around. Delayed his death a bit so i can wait for reinforcements, then bonked him for his stats to get a 2 for 5 trade with drake being ours. 

Have any of you experienced this as well? Where the enemy just, sits still for a while.<|endoftext|>While researching for the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse, I just noticed that the White Horse of Conquest seems to be like Mordekaiser (Followed by Hecarim which I'm pretty sure the Red Horse of War). What do you guys think?<|endoftext|>So... I'll start from the beginning:

It's the part of the month when I wake up thinking about the old Morde and how much was fun to play him so, I went to search his old lore once again and other stuffs.

I arrive at one point where I ask myself who did create the old morde and I go try to search it up.

I can't find his original creator... like there is a link in the wiki that brings no where so... Do we know his original creator and, if yes, do we know if he did partecipated to his rework?

Does him even still working for Riot Games? ... I just miss old Mordekaiser and I'd like to know more of the "mind" that created him...<|endoftext|>I was playing some normal blinds today (my friend who I was playing with doesn't like playing ranked) and I came across a Teemo top lane, this poor guy could not do anything to stop me for the first 3/4 of the game... Every time we engaged he would die painfully to my passive. It was fun<|endoftext|>Long story short :I finally got to play some morde , surprise surprise riftmaker felt like absolute garbage compared to old liandry's and since I had nothing better to do. I looked the burn's damage of all 3 liandry's items :the og liandry (wich is objectively the best) , the current one ( gives mana so don't even think about it) , demonic embrace ( wich is the weakest of all three like it's so weak compared to the other two it's kinds sad).

So what does this have to do with riftmaker? It takes forever to kill someone with that thing since it doesn't deal %Max HP damage . Maybe I should go to a more bursty mythic?<|endoftext|>Q is like a building falling on you, his W gives him 2 billion shield and heals him full hp, his E reaches the length of a football field and his R is just the u R fucked button and his passive sends millions of fireants to bite away at your health. op champ rito pls nerf ty :)<|endoftext|>^(TL:DR: is there any old morde main who can play the new one without falling asleep?)

^(To all the players who loved the old morde, do you still play him after rework? When I got back into league I saw his rework and thought it was a joke. This champ is extremely linear and anyone who is decent knows how to play vs him. There is not a single outplay potential except landing your 2 skills shots and wtf is this new W? The second cast feels like riot is literally poking fun at old morde main to make us understand that, they did, in fact, gut our champion to sell more skin to new players without any respect for the morde community. Like why not make a new champ to be that dumb skill-less, expressionless ap juggernaut and then rework mordekaiser for real? Even now I see so many people complaining but riot doesn't give a single fuck. As long as money come in right?)

R.I.P Mordekaiser<|endoftext|>1- teamfights: how to improve in team fights with mordekaiser cuz I feel I make alot of mistakes

3- I have most of the Dark star chromas exept the dark red one and the green one, is there a way to get them ?<|endoftext|>I was rummaging through some old highlights of mine on the laptop because I was wanting to spark some nostalgia, and came across this beauty. The clip itself is short and of poor quality, but it's a special memory for me, and one of the reasons I loved playing Morde.

[https://youtu.be/hplwX9\_APV8](https://youtu.be/hplwX9_APV8)<|endoftext|>ive been playing the new morde since rework and this has started to happen over and over again this preseason where my ult just doesnt work and goes on cd... im wondering if it has happened to some others because it is really annoying when someone doesnt have qss or any unstoppables that can cancel my ult in a teamfight where it matters and i just sit there like a duck with my ult on cd.<|endoftext|>Tank morde is sadly the best build now, morde is not about damage anymore but about out sustaining

i myself started building grasp instead of conqueror and i build sunfire aegis first, after that i get demonics and tank items that also givee sustain (Spirits visage, thornmail) and attack speed boots and ive been having alot of good games on it.

Edit: Morde not more<|endoftext|>I'm new to league and i play a lot of morde, but in my last game the ult just been canceled like 1sec after entering in the realm and  i get a quick buff but my ennemi just ran away.



I think i was attached to Rell competence if it can help :/<|endoftext|>Ignore Vlad for the Poll because He could Just Not Auto so.
Not matchup specific but Like someone that heals a Bunch(Aatrox, Fiora, Vayne etc.). 

Since Changes I nearly have Always a bramle AS one of my First items No seekers anymore and i and build IT Out 75% third Item and sometimes second when i they Focus me hard with ad laner and jgl.
 I think Thornmail is a must buy in 90% of the Games. We can all agree that there is a Lot of damage in this season and i feel Like that Thornmail will be a Must buy If the damage of everything stay that high.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kpwodd)<|endoftext|>When are mordekaisers powerspikes?<|endoftext|>I'm going full tank on morde, except for the mythic, riftmaker. Is that a bad idea?<|endoftext|>Although it might be "copying" it does seem like what the Ruined king would do, I mean hes from the shadow isles so ruling over souls sounds like his kind of deal.

This isn't official btw but its just speculation<|endoftext|>I recently saw a post on summoner school about how riftmaker isn’t good to buy as a first item on several champions, including morde. Instead, it said a better choice is Rylai’s for extra AP and HP, and then buy riftmaker second because it’s better when you have more levels and AP because it scales with omnivamp.

So, what do you guys do? Build riftmaker, rylai’s, or something else first?<|endoftext|>First, Mord is pretty weak early game, so it's hard for Mord to take a lead.

Then in the mid game 15\~25mins, I usually can only build riftmaker, plus the second item. If I build an AP item as second item, I become super squishy to burst damages, I've found S11 new items made burst damage much higher. But if I build a second tank item, I do so little damage, my total AP is less than 100. 

I honestly don't know how to play Mord anymore.<|endoftext|>

I even started using a pretty solid build, it's Frostfire Gauntlet + Demonic Embrace and Cosmic Drive the rest of the tank to be more of a front line. Greetings.<|endoftext|>Full disclosure- new player so be easy on me. Just finished a matchup with AP Malphite. He bullied me pretty good early and kept poking me with his Q and W. Made it really hard to farm and dove me 2-3 times successfully. My ADC was pretty pissed as it seems this shouldn’t be that difficult of a matchup for me. Later in the game I got fairly strong and could handle him but he had a decent gold lead at this point from the early kills. What did I do wrong or should I have done to play this better. 
Thanks!<|endoftext|>So I know that there's a bit of a void that's been left by Old Morde, now that the current version of him is around, and I wanted to share some ideas I thought of as a big fan of the character that seemed like they would be fun to see in the game :)

Obviously I'm no game designer or balance expert, this is more for the idea of fun than a legit attempt at saying they need to be implemented.

Q change: Would be cool to see his Q have a charge  based system like how Taric has his Q recharge stacks that give bonus heals based on the stack. Were this to be the case, maybe Morde could have a 3 charge buildup where if you tap it with one stack you get an empowered melee for each charge you have stored, with upwards of 3 that could function like his old Q. Conversely, you could hold Q to do the aoe bonk that he has now if you have at least 2 stacks.



W/Passive change: Would be kind of neat to see the 3 hit thing for his passive gone and instead revert the two abilities to function somewhat like how they do now, but in opposite places like they used to be. By this, I mean to say he could regain his on command brief movement speed with aoe damage (and maybe heals?) and also get back the shield based on taking/dealing damage that his passive was and his w sort of is now. Feels like it would be easier for pushing like he used to do and good for dueling, especially into ranged laners and turning teamfights.



E change: I think how it is now is pretty solid tbh, though maybe adding a bit of damage around the hand so that if you miss, you at least tap them and give you a little bit of shield for your trouble could be nice. Could help with lane pushing/wave management as well. Think of like a mix of his current and old E, with an appearance/shape that would be similar to Sett's W.



R change: I'd love to see ghosts back in the game but there's no way that's happening, let's be real, that's why he always broke the game on a tech level lol. I think his current ult could immediately become top tier if you had the ability to cancel it early to refund a small portion of the cooldown and forgo the stat stealing part of his ult that you get for getting a takedown inside of the bone zone. It would make him great for baiting out ults like J4 and Illaoi, as well as briefly pulling someone in to cancel their ult's impact like Shen, Ryze, Karthus, or Vel'Koz due to separating them from the fight briefly via sending them to a different map layer.



Again, this is just a fun theory crafting sort of post that I wanted to share with you guys, it's not meant to be an actual design change and it's not meant to be a criticism of the champ's old or new state. I love this sort of stuff so hopefully someone finds this interesting too. Lemme know whatcha think :)<|endoftext|>

[Traditional Mordekaiser](https://preview.redd.it/jj3cp6j9cq861.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=422af22b58125a52c878f6edd98e0178b51f3181)<|endoftext|>On the 8th of january, we officially start season 11 and are most likely getting another banger cinematic to bring in the new age. Each night before i sleep i pray to god, allah, buddha, whoever will listen, that mordekaiser shows up in the cinematic. Maybe it ends with a shot of him getting ready to leave Mitna Rachnun with his army, maybe the cinematic starts with someone reading the history of Sahn Uzal. I'll even take a name drop. I just really want morde to show up. god i love this man<|endoftext|>
